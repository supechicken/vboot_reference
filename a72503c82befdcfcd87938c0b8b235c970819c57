      "message": "This isn\u0027t guarded by `USE_LIBAVB` but it should be. Also, it would be nicer if we only did this once we have decided to use an Android partition.\n\nIs there a reason you can\u0027t just call this from within `vb2_load_android()`? (That may make us call it twice in rare edge cases, but that should only happen when something is wrong (e.g. one disk slot corrupted) so I don\u0027t think the performance impact really matters.)",
