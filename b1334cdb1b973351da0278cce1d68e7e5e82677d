      "message": "Sorry for always adding more stuff, but I\u0027d kinda like to be able to test a guarantee that the hwcrypto stuff is never called when allow_hwcrypto is not set. Can you add a fourth state HWCRYPTO_ABORT and make it vb2ex_abort() in that case? Then set it to that state for the range of tests where allow_hwcrypto is supposed to be off. (Would kinda like to have something like that for the RSA modexp stuff too now that I think of it...)",
