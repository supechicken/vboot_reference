      "message": "It\u0027s because factory/RMA shims require the dev switch to be on, or RO firmware won\u0027t verify them.  That\u0027s to prevent someone from giving normal users a factory shim masquerading as a regular recovery USB key.\n\nRMA flow is:\n- 3-finger salute to recovery mode\n- Turn dev switch on at the INSERT screen.  That reboots.  \n- Then at the TONORM screen, 3-finger salute to recovery mode\n- Now the shim will boot\n\nIf we skipped the TONORM screen, then it\u0027s race conditiony for RMA to manually recover before TO_NORM_CONFIRM would finish - particularly on detachables where it\u0027s a 9-sec wait before the 3-finger combo triggers recovery mode.",

Can\u0027t you just configure the right menu, disable the right indices and then reuse the normal dev-mode loop? You\u0027ll have to add another check to the shortcut options (Ctrl+D and friends) but that still seems easier that having all this code up here again...)",
