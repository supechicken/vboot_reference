      "message": "Ok, I\u0027m up for that.  I\u0027ll insert one CL before this one that does it, cq-dependent on a depthcharge CL that removes it as well.  It really should go before this work, or else it either gets wrapped up in EC sync (which means keeping devidx, etc.), or in auxfw sync, which would then have to keep the hashing, etc. and potentially require a \u0027devidx\u0027 argument for auxfw callbacks.",

      "message": "Uhh... where\u0027s this going? We still need that. (We probably need to split this up in two callbacks, because it does two separate things in depthcharge right now... block the boot until we have enough charge, and lock down TCPC tunnels. The former needs to go with the EC sync and the latter needs to stay with auxfw.)",
