      "message": "Nononono, that\u0027s not what this code was doing. It was trying to read the flags, and *if* that failed, it would set suitable defaults for recovery mode or error out otherwise. The expected case is still that the read succeeds and then recovery mode works same as normal.\n\nI think since you have the recovery mode default handling hidden in the secdata functions now, you don\u0027t need to special case anything here anymore. Just do\n\n flags \u003d vb2_secdata_firmware_get(...);\n\nand everything should work itself out automatically.",

      "message": "Still a bit confused here... one of the test cases is depending on VB2_NV_DISABLE_DEV_REQUEST being left alone if secdata_firmware can\u0027t be accessed.  I guess the idea is that if secdata_firmware is broken, it may start working on a subsequent boot, in which case we should keep VB2_NV_DISABLE_DEV_REQUEST around?\n\nOr should we just get rid of this extra logic and remove the test case?",

Given that we want to use this in both the getter (return uint32_t) and the setter (return void), the macro might be a bit complex to bother with.\n\nAlthough -- the more VB2_DIE calls we start sprinkling around, the more I wonder whether depthcharge should try to boot into recovery mode instead of just dying on vb2ex_abort()?
