      "message": "Oh, right, now I remember... I only filed a bug for this (crbug.com/655423) and left it to Stefan for triage which of course means nothing ever happened to it. ;)\n\nNow that you\u0027ve made it so this would essentially be a one-liner, can you please add it? But I don\u0027t think it should go in RW_PRESERVE... we should either have *everything* (including NVRAM) in there, or we should leave it for only board-specific stuff and have the generic sections all handled separately. RW_ELOG exists on every board (at least in the last 5 years), and they\u0027d all benefit from preserving it. It makes debugging update issues on dogfood devices easier.",
