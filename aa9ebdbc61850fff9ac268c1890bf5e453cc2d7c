      "message": "This is conceptually incorrect, as GKI doesn\u0027t have a vb2_kernel_preamble. Prior to this change, `vb2_kernel_params.flags` comes from `vb2_kernel_preamble.flags`, which is set by the signer. For GKI, however, we\u0027re setting `vb2_kernel_params.flags` directly from the firmware code, so that means we\u0027re decoupling `vb2_kernel_params.flags` from the preamble flags.\n\nTherefore I\u0027d suggest we rename the constants here to `VB2_KERNEL_TYPE_*` (dropping `PREAMBLE`), and refer to them in comments of `vb2_kernel_preamble.flags` and `vb2_kernel_params.flags`. We can also take the chance to expose them to depthcharge via 2api.h, so that depthcharge doesn\u0027t need to re-define these values.",
