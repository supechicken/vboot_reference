      "message": "Good point. I think this is already handled correctly in the actual code (see cgpt_create.c:GptCreate(), where it calculates the actual amount of sectors needed for 128 entries). But it might be nice to add some extra tests (either here or on a higher level in run_cgpt_tests.sh) to ensure that this calculates the correct amount of sectors for the 512 and 4096 cases.",
