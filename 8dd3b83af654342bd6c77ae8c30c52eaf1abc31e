      "message": "Something is still off here, why do we have two lines guarded by NO_BUILD_TOOLS back to back now? I actually don\u0027t get the intention here... is there anything we\u0027re building at all when NO_BUILD_TOOLS is set (because according to the above, we\u0027re not building the firmware libs either)?\n\nLooks like this was introduced for building the fuzzers, and I somewhat waved it through without really thinking about it (CL:1761012). But on closer inspection I don\u0027t think it really makes sense to add a variable that prevents it from building all but one target. Wouldn\u0027t it make more sense to get rid of this and just change src_compile() in the ebuild to do something like\n\n if use fuzzer; then\n   vemake BUILD\u003d\"${WORKDIR}\"/build-main fuzzers\n else\n   vemake BUILD\u003d\"${WORKDIR}\"/build-main all\n fi\n\n?",

      "message": "Yeah... seems like using environment variables to control what is compiled generally complicates things.  I\u0027m not entirely sure how the fuzzers work -- but it seems like if we are attempting to skip compiling everything else via NO_BUILD_TOOLS guards, then an ebuild with USE\u003dfuzzer only needs to install the fuzzer binaries and that\u0027s it?\n\nIf that\u0027s correct, then let\u0027s just run the fuzzer_install lines in src_install(), and skip everything else.  How does that sound?  (See latest PS.)",
