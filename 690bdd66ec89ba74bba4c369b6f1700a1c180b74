      "message": "IMO this shouldn\u0027t be moved, since most quirks are unrelated to the flash behavior. For the read command I think it\u0027s fine to always use libflashrom. The `external_flashrom` quirk was introduced only for debugging purposes (see the open comments on CL:3500339). Now that people have been using futility with libflashrom for a while, I think libflashrom is stable enough for us to always use it, especially for the read command, which is much simpler than the update command.",
