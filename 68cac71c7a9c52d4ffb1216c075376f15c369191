      "message": "as a general comment - why are so many interface integers are of the uint64_t type when it is not called for?\n\nCan these be changed to \u0027int\u0027 to be of the optimal compiler chosen size (presumably we not going to use compilers with integers of less than 32 bits).\n\nOr maybe define a generic integer type to use, and have it defined such that still the compiler default is used, and if a 16 bit integers ever come along - we would change this generic integer type definition to be 32 bits in size.",

      "message": "I may be forgetting, but I think we decided to be explicit about the size wherever we could - especially for data that was read and/or was passed around various layers.\n\nBeing explicit about size avoids subtle overflow/underflow errors and makes it easy for checking these error conditions too.\n\nLetting the compiler decide the size is problematic - what if it decides different sizes on ARM vs. x86, 32-bit vs. 64-bit compilation. I know that unsigned int is typically guaranteed to be 32-bit wide but I\u0027d rather be explicit about the expected size everywhere.",
