Probably wouldn\u0027t really make sense to have firmware exclusive to a certain mode.\n\nAnyway, feel free to propose getting rid of these somehow in a follow-up CL if you want. But as long as they\u0027re still listed here, they should be written in a manner consistent with the others. (Maybe add a \"these seem to be unused\" comment for now?)",
