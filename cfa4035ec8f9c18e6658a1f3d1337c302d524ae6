      "message": "Currently mosys does not rely heavily on the device tree (though it could use it if we want). The difference between mkbp and flash kick in with the low-level access method, and in this case mosys is our abstraction layer.\n\nThe reason I chose this method is because crossystem has a mosys wrapper and mosys has a flashrom wrapper, so the pieces are readily available and fairly simple to use. We could have crossystem handle some or all of this more directly, but that would entail a lot of duplication.",
