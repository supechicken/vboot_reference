      "message": "I see that the CQ failure is in one of the futility tests. More specifically the test fails when it emulates a full update. Based on the failure, either the input image is invalid or the check for ME lock does not apply to older platforms.\n\nBased on the logs, the test is emulating a FW update from src/platform/vboot_reference/test/futility/data/bios_peppy_mp.bin to src/platform/vboot_reference/test/futility/data/bios_link_mp.bin\n\nIn both the FROM_IMAGE and TO_IMAGE ME is locked.

I am not sure what is the right fix to the test.",

      "message": "Posted a comment on updater_utils.c. Probably we can assume that the ME is not locked in emulation mode.\n\nI think the right solution might be to ensure that the bios images have the ME regions formatted correctly to reflect that ME region access is enabled for BIOS since the test is attempting to actually update the entire flash. But, I am not sure about the history of the test images. Hung-Te might be able to provide the background.",
