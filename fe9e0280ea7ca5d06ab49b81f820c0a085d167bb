      "message": "Well... no, now this would be messing up the kernel version with old VBSD versions again, because for the kernel, kernel_version_tpm has actually always contained the final TPM version (not the currently booted version like for firmware_version_tpm). So in order to make sure that old VBSDs automatically have everything in the right place (as best as they can), we need to rename the fields like this:\n\n* fw_version_tpm -\u003e fw_version_act\n* fw_version_tpm_start -\u003e fw_verison_tpm (I don\u0027t think the \u0027final\u0027 really adds anything useful here when we won\u0027t have a \u0027start\u0027 anymore)\n* kernel_version_tpm_start -\u003e kernel_version_act\n* kernel_version_tpm can stay where it is\n\nThis will result in the two `tpm` versions no longer being next to each other in the structure, but I think that\u0027s a fair price to pay if it saves us most of the hassle of translating values from old VBSD versions in crossystem.",
