      "message": "Uhh... I don\u0027t think we can do this. We\u0027re a library and we might be called from a multi-threaded application on multiple threads at once. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a likely case in practice in the way ChromeOS is using vboot but it\u0027s not really a risk you\u0027d want to take, no matter how small.\n\nI think your options are either using asprintf() and dealing with the free() everywhere, or turning this into a macro so that we end up inserting both strings in full into the binary (since it\u0027s not that many strings that would probably not be too concerning).",
