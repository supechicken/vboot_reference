      "message": "Thanks for pointing this out.  \n\nThe original source that the original change was made in contained the use of VbSharedDataKernelPart, but firmware-brya-14505.B branch does not know what a VbShareDataKernelPart is or have any code that does anything with it.\n\nI should have made this change when cherry-picking over https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/vboot_reference/+/5721004.  The code in the left column here in this change/file is the new code that was cherry-picked in with 5721004 prior to this change in the cherry-pick stack.\n\nI moved this change down lower in the stack where it belongs (i.e. the commit for 5721004 should have never brought it in).",
