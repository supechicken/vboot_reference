In that case, I\u0027m not really sure we should make so many changes to it. We should either take it out completely right now, or we should just leave it where it is (knowing that devices with romstage sync will never have it enabled anyway). (I think it\u0027s fine to take the update_slowly() part out, then it will just not show the screen when updating.)",
