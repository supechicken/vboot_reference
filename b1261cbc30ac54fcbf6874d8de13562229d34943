I think that extend integration test (e.g. `tests/futility/test_sign_kernel.sh`) for this change is acutally hard to do. It requires lots of work and would add dependency on OpenSC and OpenCryptoki since we need a fake local KMS to test it. I think we still want it, but I guess it\u0027s just a P2 for now.",
