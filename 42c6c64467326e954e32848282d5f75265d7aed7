      "message": "Why does this need to be a context flag? That function is only called from the UI loop that lives completely under a single VbSelectAndLoadFirmware() call. A global or static local variable should be enough (we use plenty of those in the menu UI, I don\u0027t see a big reason not to do that here as well). The vb2_context is really just meant for information that needs to be passed between vboot and the calling program.",
