There is a difference between the size of the structure (which is the amount of currently valid bytes that are covered by the CRC) and the MAX_SIZE (which is the maximum buffer size reserved in vb2_context that can be read from the TPM). This allows us to later make backwards-compatible additions that rev the minor version and are still compatible with older readers.",
