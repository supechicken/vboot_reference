      "message": "Could you explain why changing the return type of these functions (`find_firmware_section` in updater_utils.c, `update_ec_firmware` in updater.c and more) is better? For functions `*_exists`, `has_*` or `is_*`, I think it\u0027s clear from the function name that it returns a bool. However, for other functions I don\u0027t see the benefit of returning a bool.\n\nIf we want to prevent adding error code 1 to error code -1, we can always write `errorcnt +\u003d !!func()` instead of `errorcnt +\u003d func()` for `func` returning an int. Actually, I don\u0027t quite understand why we need to keep track of the number of errors in the first place. Can\u0027t we just return `!!errorcnt` for each function (such as `updater_setup_config`)?",

      "message": "First of all, boolean type narrows returns value domain to two values, and (IMO) is more readable for programmer. true means success, false means failure. With integer you have to always look at function documentation to be sure that for function A() zero is success and for B() non zero is success. Moreover, functions can be written (and indirectly are) to return bool. `!!` operator basically casts int to bool anyway, so why use integer instead?\nRegarding errors count - I too think it\u0027s pointless most of the time, because of `return !!errorcnt`. Also, as per commit message - some functions were returning `1` as \"number of errors\", others were returning `-1` as failure, and adding them to `errorcnt` could lead to two errors equaling to success `1 + -1 \u003d\u003d 0`. That\u0027s the second argument for removing integers whenever possible.\n\n\u003e If we want to prevent adding error code 1 to error code -1, we can always write `errorcnt +\u003d !!func()` instead...\n\u003e Can\u0027t we just return `!!errorcnt` for each function (such as `updater_setup_config`)?\n\nThat\u0027s what I do not understand. Why to use `!!` everywhere if boolean does the trick automatically and is also universally accepted as success/failure indicator. It also removes need for adding errors. Just check return value and `goto` or `return`.\n\nMaybe there is a benefit in using integer which I do not see. Maybe it\u0027s just C programmer\u0027s habit. I think, there is more benefit in using `bool` instead of `int` these days, as it carries context information without need for looking for documentation so often. But that\u0027s my preference, and I\u0027m open to discussion :D",
