      "message": "No, I think it\u0027s not quite that easy. Right now this is still hooked up to FLAG_RECSW, and many mainboards have a pseudo-GPIO for \"recovery\" defined in coreboot. That would always be 1 here (because sysinfo_install_flags() installs \"recovery\" as don\u0027t-resample-at-runtime unless the board overrides it with an explicit flag_replace()).\n\nWe should change this to check FLAG_PRESENCE instead, and change all the boards with physical recovery button to install that button as \"presence\" flag instead, and then get rid of the \"recovery\" (pseudo-)GPIOs. And *then* we can take this out.",
