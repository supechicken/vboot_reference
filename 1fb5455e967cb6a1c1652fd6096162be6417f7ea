Recall that the latest `config` file consists of two parts: defconfig and derivable values, and CB:69955 didn\u0027t add `# CONFIG_XXX is not set` to the 2nd part. Therefore, when a bool config isn\u0027t found, it can mean either `false` or error (non-existing config, such as `CONFIG_VBOOT_CBFS_INTEGRATION` in old images). And IMO whether the error means `false` should be determined by the caller, instead of by `get_bool`.\n\nSo, in order to make these functions really \"consistent\", I think we\u0027ll have to make `false` and error distinguishable, by adding all the `... is not set` comments to the `config` CBFS file (so that `extract_config_value` can also search the requested config in comments).\n\nPS4: `get_string` is modified as suggested.",
