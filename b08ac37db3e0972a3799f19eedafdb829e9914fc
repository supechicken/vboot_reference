      "message": "I know it\u0027s not done consistently in this file but I\u0027d generally recommend to use `\u003d` (or better `:\u003d`), not `?\u003d` for these sort of things. Both are overrideable on the command line, but the difference is that `?\u003d` can be overridden from environment variables while `\u003d` and `:\u003d` can only be overridden from explicit parameter (e.g. `make PARAM\u003dvalue`). Most of the time you intend it to be used the latter way, and using environment variables is usually unintended for anything other than a few very standard variables (like `CC` or `CFLAGS`).",
