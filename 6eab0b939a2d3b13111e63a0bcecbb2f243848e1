      "message": "I agree the naming is a bit difficult, although at least it is symmetric with vb2_workbuf_from_ctx(). I don\u0027t really think your suggestions make it better, though. ;)\n\nHow about just changing vb2_set_workbuf_used() to do this instead? I don\u0027t really think we should have both anyway... if we want to add this new function to make workbuf handling more abstract, I think the existing use cases of vb2_set_workbuf_used() should be changed to use that as well (because they\u0027re not really doing anything fundamentally different, although they may need minor rewrites to fit the new function in some cases).",
