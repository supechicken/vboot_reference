Yes, my suggestion above would change the behavior, but that could be solved by adding USE_FLASHROM\u003d1 in vboot ebuild.

The change of behavior that is actually required here *is* on coreboot\u0027s side and therefore a explicit `USE_FLASHROM\u003d0` is required there.\n\nHere is my reasoning,\n\nWe certainly can add an explicit `USE_FLASHROM\u003d1` in the ebuild. However that would be the default state. The string name is irreverent to the fact there is three possible states, true, false or undefined. I rather a pure boolean state of defined as default to true, which is the current behavior, and let coreboot special case since it *is* the special case after all.",

      "message": "Thanks for creating the coreboot patch.\n\nI\u0027m still not quite convinced of the usage of \u0027filter-out 1\u0027 here. Let me make myself a little bit clearer. My point is all about consistency for all vboot options (such as TPM2_MODE, EC_EFS). All of them are currently parsed with \u0027filter-out 0\u0027. I wouldn\u0027t interpret that as a tri-state variable. Instead, anything other than 0 will be treated like 1 (enable). For example, depthcharge is passing \u0027y\u0027 to enable an option. I think we\u0027d like to keep it that way for all make variables in this file for consistency.\n\nIf you want the default to be true, we could simply add\n\n USE_FLASHROM ?\u003d 1\n\nthen follow my suggestion of using \u0027filter-out 0\u0027. What do you think?",
