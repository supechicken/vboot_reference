Yes, my suggestion above would change the behavior, but that could be solved by adding USE_FLASHROM\u003d1 in vboot ebuild. Alternatively, we could revert the option as NO_FLASHROM (so that flashrom would be enabled by default, if that\u0027s what you want).",

The change of behavior that is actually required here *is* on coreboot\u0027s side and therefore a explicit `USE_FLASHROM\u003d0` is required there.\n\nHere is my reasoning,\n\nWe certainly can add an explicit `USE_FLASHROM\u003d1` in the ebuild. However that would be the default state. The string name is irreverent to the fact there is three possible states, true, false or undefined. I rather a pure boolean state of defined as default to true, which is the current behavior, and let coreboot special case since it *is* the special case after all.",
