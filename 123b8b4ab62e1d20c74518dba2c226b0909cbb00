I mean, right now we want to know the TPM space size of vboot1\u0027s kernel space, so I think we should get that through sizeof(struct RollbackSpaceKernel) from rollback_index.h instead. One day we might want to know the size of vboot2\u0027s kernel space, which may be completely different, and then we might define that like this.",
