      "message": "Apology for the really late reviews. For documentation purposes, just want to leave some general opinions regarding the unit testing in vboot_reference.\n\n1. IMO cmocka is preferred over the testing framework invented by vboot itself. With cmocka, we wouldn\u0027t need to implement the ugly `ASSERT()` macro and friends. If we\u0027re introducing unit tests to futility, we may consider starting using cmocka.\n2. In the long term we\u0027d like to get rid of `test_mockable`. Right now that depends on the separation of test builds from host utility builds.
