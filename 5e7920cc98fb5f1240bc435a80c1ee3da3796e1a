      "message": "I am not against this change, but curious: can you tell us on what system and with which calling firmware you\u0027re intending to use vboot on RISC-V? Is this an open source project?\n\nAlso, be aware that the part you\u0027re changing is pretty vestigial and not really used anymore (on any architecture), we just never really had time to clean up that part of the Makefile. In practice, all firmwares integrating vboot are passing `CFLAGS` and `CC` explicitly which overrides anything defined in that part of the Makefile. You can see here how it\u0027s done on coreboot, for example: https://github.com/coreboot/coreboot/blob/main/src/security/vboot/Makefile.mk#L25",
