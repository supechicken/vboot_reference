      "message": "There are 2 problems:\n\n1. See CL:5046147.\n2. We use empty `FIRMWARE_ARCH` when building vboot_fw.a for depthcharge unit tests, so `COMMON_FLAGS` will be appended. However `CC\u003dHOSTCC\u003dgcc` doesn\u0027t have `-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types`. I think the correct solution is to pass `FIRMWARE_ARCH\u003dmock` for depthcharge unit tests, and handle that in vboot\u0027s Makefile (where we want firmware/2lib/2stub.c but not `-DCHROMEOS_ENVIRONMENT ${COMMON_FLAGS}`).",
