      "message": "There are 2 problems:\n\n1. See CL:5046147.\n2. We use empty `FIRMWARE_ARCH` when building vboot_fw.a for depthcharge unit tests, so `COMMON_FLAGS` will be appended. However `CC\u003dHOSTCC\u003dgcc` doesn\u0027t have `-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types`. I think the correct solution is to pass `FIRMWARE_ARCH\u003dmock` for depthcharge unit tests, and handle that in vboot\u0027s Makefile (where we want firmware/2lib/2stub.c but not `-DCHROMEOS_ENVIRONMENT ${COMMON_FLAGS}`).",

      "message": "Yeah I think the FIRMWARE_ARCH\u003dmock suggestion makes sense, we should have some kind of system where it\u0027s clear whether the flags get passed in or come from this Makefile, this weird mix is not healthy. (We may also want to consider moving the `-std\u003dgnu11` and `test_ccflag` stuff, which is currently applied to all builds but would probably also better be omitted if everything else gets passed in.)",
