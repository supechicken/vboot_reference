Shouldn\u0027t this be `names[j]` (for the `j` that went out of scope earlier)?\n\nI feel like this would be easier if we just extracted right up there in the loop, before we print (maybe by moving that code into a separate function). Then you also don\u0027t need `extract_names[j]` anymore afterwards and could maybe just set that to `NULL` so you don\u0027t need a separate flag.",
