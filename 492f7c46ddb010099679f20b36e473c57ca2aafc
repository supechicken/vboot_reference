I don\u0027t see why we shouldn\u0027t mark it as such.  As for the term \"vendor data\" -- there\u0027s around 4 different terms being used, and in the Groot screens, we settled on \"serial number\".",

      "message": "You say that but I feel like every time I turn my back to those RMA \"Serviceability\" guys they come up with yet another idea about expanding Wilco hacks to the rest of the fleet. Here\u0027s something about serial numbers, for example: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VwWLHJACRXjAd-b-6vuwoLHp70goPeh3e0JPsdzfIjw (and actually, in one of the comments there there is also talk about setting certain fields in CBI like the SKU ID \"from firmware\"... I think if we tried to design that we would end up reusing the same screen and API,  just with a different effect in depthcharge).\n\nAnyway, I\u0027m okay calling it \"serial\" for now if you want I just find it weird to put the name \"wilco\" into vboot. vboot is supposed to provide platform-agnostic features.",
