(If this is intended for developer mode, then be aware that the code you\u0027re changing here only runs after the user has selected \"boot from internal disk\" or let the boot timer expire. If we want this to be able to immediately transition us to the fastboot screen upon reboot, we probably need to read the misc partition earlier in the flow already.)",
