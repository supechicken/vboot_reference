      "message": "For data types that get serialized, it\u0027s definitely always a good idea to use a fixed-width type. We\u0027re not UEFI but we still have cases where different pieces run with different architectures.\n\nThe question is, does vb2_error_t ever actually get serialized? I can\u0027t think of a point where it does... but on the other hand, it doesn\u0027t really hurt to be careful. How about making it an int32_t, so that it\u0027s fixed-width but does still convert implicitly to an int when needed? (I mean, the other extreme would be to define it as typedef struct { uint32_t err; } and change all the constants to #define VB2_SUCCESS ((vb2_error_t){ .value \u003d 0 })... that way, you force explicit compiler checking for the type. But I\u0027m not sure we want to go that far? And you\u0027d have to introduce some weird syntax for comparison, like if (IS_VB2_SUCCESS(rv)) or something like that.)\n\nI\u0027m also wondering if we should maybe make all the values negative. In lots of other code, negative values are used for errors. If a vb2_error_t ever finds its way into a function that didn\u0027t expect it and checks it with if (rv \u003c 0), that would make it still work. (Of course, we have plenty of other examples where people are using 1 instead of -1 for their default error value so we sort of have that problem already anyway.)",

      "message": "Re. serialization:\n\n- There is one instance in vboot_kernel.c where it is stored in shcall-\u003ereturn_code (as uint8_t).\n- Another occurs in 2misc.c where the error code is passed to vb2_fail (also casted to uint8_t), which then gets stored in nvram as VB2_NV_RECOVERY_SUBCODE.\n- One location where this nvram variable is read back is in vb2_check_recovery, which has a clause of code where it may end up in sd-\u003erecovery_reason (?!?!?).\n\nAnyways, I don\u0027t think we should be too concerned since these are already ridiculous enough.\n\nRe. using a struct for typedef:\n\nI suppose that\u0027s the C way of doing an enum class?  Seems pretty unwieldy... let\u0027s stick with plain old uint32_t?\n\nRe. negative values:\n\nWe\u0027ve already put a lot of effort into maintaining stable error code values... I suppose if everything just gets switched over to its negative equivalent, that\u0027s not so bad.  But I also haven\u0027t really come across any code (rv \u003c 0) like you mentioned?  (And anyways, this should be changed to (VB2_SUCCESS !\u003d rv).)",
