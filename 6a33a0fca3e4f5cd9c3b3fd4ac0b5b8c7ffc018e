      "message": "Yes, I missed shell scripts and probably many more files. I was focusing on all C source and header files for now, because they are most edited most often.\n\nUnfortunately pre-upload.py does not support tree-wide checks, only per-patch checking. It would be nice if it did support per-file or tree-wide checks. It should not be hard to implement.\n\nYou can try to find non-matching files using regular expression from pre-upload.py `_check_cros_license() : LICENSE_HEADER` using `grep -rLE \u003cpattern\u003e . | grep -vE \u003cexclude temp/swap/bin/build files pattern\u003e`\nNotice that `LICENSE_HEADER` has capture-groups, which should be taken care of properly (new lines, comments, periods, etc.) to find files that really do not match.",
