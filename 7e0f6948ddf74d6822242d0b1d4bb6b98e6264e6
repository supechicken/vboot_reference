I almost forgot the difference of them after this change. chungsheng@  maybe you know this better.\n\nNow edisonhello@ is writing unit tests for ui_menu_select() [CL:3081223]. It\u0027s kind of weird that the return value is sometimes VB2_SUCCESS and sometimes VB2_REQUEST_UI_CONTINUE.",

      "message": "IIRC, the design is, if the control flow needs to go back to the main UI loop, the function should return REQUEST_UI_CONTINUE. This happens when the screen is changed (and it may be the only case currently). Because all the logic of the callee of this function are bound to a specific screen, if the screen is changed the control flow should break and return to the main loop. For the other cases, since the screen doesn\u0027t change, the control flow should be able to continue, so return VB2_SUCCESS.",
