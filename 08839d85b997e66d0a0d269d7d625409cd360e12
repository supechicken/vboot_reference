We\u0027re already using it here to store the recovery reason from the previous boot -- you can\u0027t just overwrite it. (Even if you could technically figure out a way to make those uses not overlap, it still seems like a bad thing to do. Surely we can find a free bit or two in a different byte for this? Maybe BOOT2 bit 7?)",
