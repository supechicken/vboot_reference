Isn\u0027t the decision you make there entirely static (e.g. based on crosid information)? And even if it must be in runtime storage, why can\u0027t you just put it in a file on disk somewhere?\n\nAlso, crossystem options that are solely used by kernel/userland and don\u0027t have anything to do with firmware control at all should usually go into the kern_nv field (see block_devmode and tpm_attack). But before that there should be a good reason why they need to be in nvdata at all.",
