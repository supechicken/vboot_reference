(I guess that can break in the same rare cases as we discussed with that hash, but maybe it\u0027s better to become aware of those and fix them manually than to have barely any coverage at all?)",

Store only the \"expected FW_MAIN_A\", and then check that\n\n  - The FMAP layout remains the same\n  - All the sections remain the same (after calling swap_ec_rw) except for FW_MAIN_A and FW_MAIN_B\n  - The modified FW_MAIN_A and FW_MAIN_B become the same as the \"expected FW_MAIN_A\"\n\n2. Use bsdiff to store only the diff, which is only 190KB.",
