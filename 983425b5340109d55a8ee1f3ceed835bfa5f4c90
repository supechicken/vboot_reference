I guess the plan was to remove sig_alg and hash_alg eventually, and replace use with vb2_guid (now vb2_id).\n\nWe could either:\n\n(1) Fork vb2_public_key into vb2_public_key (without desc, version, id) and vb21_public_key (with).  Rename vb2_id to vb21_id.\n\n(2) Remove desc, version, and id from vb2_public_key, and update vboot 2.1 code to read from sig_alg and hash_alg instead.  Remove vb2_id.\n\nThe first solution would probably require less changes, and would keep vboot 2.1 code intact just in case we want to pick and choose parts of it for a future vboot 3.0 implementation.",
