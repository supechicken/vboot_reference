      "message": "We should change the name for this if we want to export it, just `hmac()` isn\u0027t sufficiently namespaced. Maybe `vb2_hmac()`?\n\nI\u0027m also wondering if we should use this opportunity to change the function to use `struct vb2_hash`, so it could be more in line with the current hash API (and then it probably should also get an `allow_hwcrypto` argument to pass through). Could make it `vb2_hmac_calculate(allow_hwcrypto, buf, size, key, key_size, algo, output_vb2_hash)` and `vb2_hmac_verify(allow_hwcrypto, buf, size, key, key_size, vb2_hash)` to mirror the hash API. (The existing uses in Tlcl would have to be adapted then.)",
