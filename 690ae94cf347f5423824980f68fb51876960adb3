      "message": "Vadim, can you please confirm that the endianness here is correct?\n\nFor example, go/cros-dlm shows that the board ID for CoachZ should be \"GVLR\". When I run `gsctool -i -a` on my CoachZ, it shows `Board ID space: 47564c52:b8a9b3ad:00007f7f`.\n\nWhen I run this code with `futility gscvd -b GVLR`, that would now be the equivalent of running `futility gscvd -b 47564c52`. However, since this is stored in the GSCVD descriptor in host byte order (little-endian), in a hexdump of the resulting GSCVD it actually shows up as 52 4c 56 47 (i.e. RLVG). Is that the order that cr50/ti50 expect it in?",
