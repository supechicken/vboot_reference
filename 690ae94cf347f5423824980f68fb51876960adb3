      "message": "Vadim, can you please confirm that the endianness here is correct?\n\nFor example, go/cros-dlm shows that the board ID for CoachZ should be \"GVLR\". When I run `gsctool -i -a` on my CoachZ, it shows `Board ID space: 47564c52:b8a9b3ad:00007f7f`.\n\nWhen I run this code with `futility gscvd -b GVLR`, that would now be the equivalent of running `futility gscvd -b 47564c52`. However, since this is stored in the GSCVD descriptor in host byte order (little-endian), in a hexdump of the resulting GSCVD it actually shows up as 52 4c 56 47 (i.e. RLVG). Is that the order that cr50/ti50 expect it in?",

      "message": "To clarify, I am asking whether storing it in the GSCVD as little-endian is correct. I agree that the tool should take big-endian notation on the command line (e.g. `futility gscvd -b ZZCR` or `-b 5a5a4352`, not `-b RCZZ` or `-b 52435a5a`). However, with the way the existing code here was already written, that would end up as `RCZZ`/`52 43 5a 5a` in the hex dump of the resulting GSCVD structure. I just want to confirm that that\u0027s working as intended.",
