      "message": "Something seems wrong here, this amount of rebooting is a bit ridiculous. I know we\u0027re not doing a good job integrating the CSE-triggered reboots with the rest of the flow, but at least for the EC and display stuff I recall us explicitly making sure to avoid extra reboots there where possible (IIRC Karthik wrote that, a while back). Boot 4 and boot 7 should be unnecessary because the display request should have been automatically set/unset in boot 2 / boot 5 already.\n\nCompare CL:1592472, where this was first explicitly designed to work that way (see how it calls `check_reboot_for_display()` right before rebooting to RO to make sure the DISPLAY_REQUEST flag is already set correctly, and how it disables display after `ec_sync_update_aux_fw()` even in the non-zero path where we go into a reboot). Did we break something there during all the EC sync refactoring that happened since? Or did this just not work right because VBOOT_ALWAYS_ENABLE_DISPLAY wasn\u0027t set correctly for this board?",

      "message": "\u003e Did we break something there during all the EC sync refactoring that happened since?\n\nYes, we did.\n\n- Enabling DISPLAY_REQUEST was changed in CL:2117776, which can be fixed by passing `EC_SLOW_UPDATE` to vboot (either via build-time option or another callback `vb2ex_ec_update_need_display()`).\n- Disabling DISPLAY_REQUEST was changed in CL:1634453 (a few days after Karthik\u0027s CL). From our previous discussions on b/243793671, the conclusion was to disable DISPLAY_REQUEST at the end of `vb2api_auxfw_sync()` (not at the end of EC sync). However no one seems to have ever done that. Note that this will NOT save boot 7 in this example.\n\n\u003e Or did this just not work right because VBOOT_ALWAYS_ENABLE_DISPLAY wasn\u0027t set correctly for this board?\n\nThat\u0027s a separate issue. I\u0027ve uploaded CB:83256 to fix it, which will bypass the problem mentioned above, for the next Intel platform.",
