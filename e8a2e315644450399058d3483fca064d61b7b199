      "message": "It is not the problem with this CL, since precedence was already done with `ENTRY_ACTIVE|INVALID`, but for me `GptUpdateKernelWithEntry` feels strange. Why this function isn\u0027t split into separate functions? Then each variant could have different parameter list instead of relaying on special fields in `GptData` structure. But as I said, the problem isn\u0027t introduced by this CL, so I guess we can refactor that later.",
