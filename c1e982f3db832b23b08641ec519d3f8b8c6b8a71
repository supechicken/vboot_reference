I think this would be a good opportunity to replace the existing uses of host_shell() in the updater code with that.\n\n(There also seems to be a bunch of cbfstool wrapping code in updater_utils.c and we now have host/lib/cbfstool.c to do that in a more organized way, so if anyone has some free time that would also be a great thing to fix. Although I admit it has nothing to do with this CL anymore.)",
