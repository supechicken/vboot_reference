Not all programmers access flash on the local host (in fact, most don\u0027t). And if you happen to use a host that also runs coreboot to e.g. write with a Servo programmer to a different DUT, you may read an entirely wrong FMAP. I think you need to check that you\u0027re actually operating on an internal programmer somewhere.",
