      "message": "Sorry, I don\u0027t have time to review this CL in detail, but just to comment on the general approach: isn\u0027t this entirely programmer-dependent? Not all programmers access flash on the local host (in fact, most don\u0027t). And if you happen to use a host that also runs coreboot to e.g. write with a Servo programmer to a different DUT, you may read an entirely wrong FMAP. I think you need to check that you\u0027re actually operating on an internal programmer somewhere.",

      "message": "Good point. It worked because `locate_fmap_using_cbmem` extracts only the FMAP position using `cbmem`, and then reads flash to get the actual (and therefore always correct) FMAP structure.\nNevertheless, I will add a check for the remote update case.",
