      "message": "nit: I commented about this on the depthcharge side already (I hope you still got notified about my comments since the patch was abandoned?): Is there a good reason to enforce this across the interface? It seems a bit \"unclean\" to me if vboot needs to honor some alignments and sizes that it doesn\u0027t even know, for completely implementation-specific reasons. Wouldn\u0027t it be safer to make the depthcharge code a little smarter and align the reads itself? (We could still make sure vboot just \"happens\" to get the alignment right so we don\u0027t waste boot time reading a block twice in the common case, but I\u0027m a little worried that something somewhere might somehow change down the road that could break this assumption in a way we won\u0027t notice soon enough.)",

      "message": "Oh, sorry, I didn\u0027t see the comment. OK, you and everyone else who pointed this out (Randall, Gwendal) are right--this really is a messy interface the way I\u0027ve designed it. I guess I was afraid that a minor change to vboot would make it happen to get things wrong, but really that performance problem could be debugged when/if it comes up, if it really is a performance problem (flash reads or hashing or RSA verification might dominate the runtime anyway).\n\nHow about this: the initial version will have this weird restriction, while I\u0027m getting it off the ground, but I\u0027ll try to remove the restriction before release?",
