      "message": "nit: I commented about this on the depthcharge side already (I hope you still got notified about my comments since the patch was abandoned?): Is there a good reason to enforce this across the interface? It seems a bit \"unclean\" to me if vboot needs to honor some alignments and sizes that it doesn\u0027t even know, for completely implementation-specific reasons. Wouldn\u0027t it be safer to make the depthcharge code a little smarter and align the reads itself? (We could still make sure vboot just \"happens\" to get the alignment right so we don\u0027t waste boot time reading a block twice in the common case, but I\u0027m a little worried that something somewhere might somehow change down the road that could break this assumption in a way we won\u0027t notice soon enough.)",
