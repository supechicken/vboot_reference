      "message": "\u003e So this means that the diff is never measured for files of error level 2\n\nThat\u0027s intentional. If a command fails, I think the caller shouldn\u0027t trust its output. I\u0027d say the same for a function `int f(.., char *out)`. When it returns an error, the caller shouldn\u0027t trust `out`.\n\nNow CL:4940542 is moved prior to this CL, so I guess there\u0027s no problem for `bios_coachz_cbfs` anymore?",
