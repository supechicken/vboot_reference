      "message": "The old vboot1 structs explicitly specified one signature and one SHA-512 hash.  The hash was never used by firmware keyblocks, only kernel keyblocks\n\nThe new vboot2 structs allow multiple signatures per keyblock.  Which we\u0027ll need for LOEM-signed firmware and kernels.  If I allow bare hash signatures as well, I can treat hashes just like other signatures, which makes the parsing code easier.\n\nFuture algorithms like ECC will go after the hashes.  So, for example,\n\n   VB2_ALG_ECC128_SHA256 \u003d 15\n\nand we won\u0027t bother with all permutations of (signature type)*(hash type), because realistically we only use a few.  For example, we only use algorithms 4, 7, and 11 today, but we have the test overhead for all 12 RSA+SHA algorithms.",
