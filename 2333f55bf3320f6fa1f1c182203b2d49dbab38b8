      "message": "Changing this straight-up creates a circular dependency between coreboot and vboot, which is difficult to upstream. It\u0027s usually easier to add both names for an intermediary period, e.g.\n```\nVB2_GBB_FLAG_DEPRECATED_RUNNING_FAFT \u003d 1 \u003c\u003c 8,\nVB2_GBB_FLAG_RUNNING_FAFT \u003d 1 \u003c\u003c 8,\n```\nsync that to upstream, then change all the names upstream, and then remove the older name here. (Alternatively, if that\u0027s the decision on CL:5714819, you can completely remove all upstream references to this name first, and then you can change it without any dependencies.)",
