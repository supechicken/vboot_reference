      "message": "Sorry, why do you want to do this? What do our dev keys have to do with prod signing?\n\nChanging dev keys would be a big disruption to developers who\u0027d suddenly have the images they build not match the older firmware flashed to their devices anymore. We should not touch them unless we have a _really_ good reason that would warrant a lot of wasted developer time.",

      "message": "As part of the ChromeOS signing scaling project, we\u0027re migrating to Cloud KMS, which does not support 8K RSA (see go/cros-signing:8k24k). It is my intention to place a set of dev keys in a Cloud KMS key ring so that there is a local development story for the new signing flow, and @vapier@chromium.org suggested that I use the known dev keys for consistency. This requires migration from 8K to 4K RSA so that they can be stored in Cloud KMS.\n\nI started a thread about this (https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/g/chromeos-chatty-firmware/c/c-1FHIVmzio/m/onHeIwOmBAAJ) as well, hopefully this provides enough context.\n\nOpen to any other suggestions on how to proceed here",
