      "message": "Yeah. I could lower it if desired (I don\u0027t think I ever saw even more than a single retry needed). To some extent I kinda like it being long but not too long. If somehow things got busted and this failed constantly (timing out every time) then running \"crossystem\" would take a second to fail. Hopefully it would mean that a user\u0027s system wasn\u0027t terribly blocked but also that someone would notice and dig out the root cause.\n\nDefinitely having _some_ type of obvious failure is good because (right now) we default to doing completely the wrong thing (returning the unpopulated \"boot wp\" value).",
