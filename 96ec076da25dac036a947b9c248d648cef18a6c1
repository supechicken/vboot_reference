That\u0027s okay, but it means that this tool won\u0027t build outside the chroot, and it\u0027s often handy to be able to build all the utilities outside. Can we figure out a way to not attempt it? \n\nI\u0027d suggest moving mount-encrypted out of the default TARGET_NAMES, and adding an \"else\" clause to the MINIMAL \"if\" selection.\n\nThanks.",
