      "message": "Ahh, here we go.\n\nI think it would make more sense if you didn\u0027t go back-and-forth so much within CLs of the same series. It makes sense to separate features into their own CLs where possible... but it\u0027s just confusing if you go back on what you did before within the same patch series. If it turns out that we want this as a global, the first patch introducing it should probably already have it as a global.",
