      "message": "I\u0027d split this into two functions - one for confirm-enable and one for confirm-disable.\n\nThe code path is different, because confirm-disable is done from dev mode so the TPM operation will always fail, and so it\u0027ll set VBNV_DISABLE_DEV_REQUEST.  Might as well move that VBNV set right into the confirm-disable function.",
