      "message": "I mean, we can do it this way if you want to... but with this you\u0027re achieving your goal of decoupling elogtool from vboot\u0027s flashrom-shell-out library, but still keeping a dependency to vboot\u0027s subprocess library. Are you really gaining anything here for your code duplication in elogtool? Seems like a dependency is still a dependency to me so I think you could just as well remove flashrom.c from USE_FLASHROM too and keep using that.\n\n(USE_FLASHROM should really be renamed into USE_LIBFLASHROM because the only reason for its existence is to avoid the libflashrom dependency, it doesn\u0027t need to cover any more code than what\u0027s strictly needed to achieve that.)",
