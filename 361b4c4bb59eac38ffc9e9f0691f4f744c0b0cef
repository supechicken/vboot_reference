      "message": "I mean, we can do it this way if you want to... but with this you\u0027re achieving your goal of decoupling elogtool from vboot\u0027s flashrom-shell-out library, but still keeping a dependency to vboot\u0027s subprocess library. Are you really gaining anything here for your code duplication in elogtool? Seems like a dependency is still a dependency to me so I think you could just as well remove flashrom.c from USE_FLASHROM too and keep using that.\n\n(USE_FLASHROM should really be renamed into USE_LIBFLASHROM because the only reason for its existence is to avoid the libflashrom dependency, it doesn\u0027t need to cover any more code than what\u0027s strictly needed to achieve that.)",

      "message": "Rather than duplicate the discussion in too many places I mostly replied in CB:65055\n\nActually that was the original name however a choice was made to call it just flashrom as it covers two cases of library and exec. The rename to `USE_LIBFLASHROM` would be slightly premature as it covers both the case of subprocess logic as well as libflashrom logic. Furthermore it is orthogonal to the direct issue at hand here that requires changes in a number of places simultaneously [ebuild, vboot_ref Makefile, coreboot Makefile, coreboot buildbot config]. I rather we handle that as its own problem when flashrom shell out logic is finally EOL\u0027ed.",
