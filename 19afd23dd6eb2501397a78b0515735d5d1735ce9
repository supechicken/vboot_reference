      "message": "I know I mentioned in the last CL comments that we can check for the beep starting at +/- FUZZ_MS, but I think what is really important is that it starts within FUZZ_MS *after* the expected time.  A beep should never start *early*.  So we only need one of these conditions.  Furthermore, I think the way you\u0027ve written this is really confusing...  Perhaps this would be clearer:\n\n  TEST_TRUE(cur_time \u003e\u003d beep-\u003etime_expected, \"  beep started after expected time\")\n  TEST_TRUE(cur_time - beep-\u003etime_expected \u003c FUZZ_MS, \"  beep started within FUZZ_MS\")",
