I think then it would be better to just reset this every time (without an #ifdef) we start a UI loop, i.e. in VbBootRecovery() and VbBootDeveloper(). You could encapsulate that into an init_ui() function too if you want. We have something similar in the menu UI already to perform some initialization.",
