There\u0027s no Google C coding style to my knowledge, and we don\u0027t follow the Google C++ style for our code... instead, we mostly (unofficially) follow coreboot style in vboot and depthcharge, which is 95% copied from Linux (which also likes to do this a lot).\n\nSo I don\u0027t think this really comes up much in vboot, but if it did we\u0027d probably want to allow it.",
