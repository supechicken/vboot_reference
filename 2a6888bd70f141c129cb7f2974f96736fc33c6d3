      "message": "I think it would be better to just add ${CPPFLAGS} here. It\u0027s a small deduplication, and more importantly I would be worried about affecting firmware builds. The whole flags stuff in here is a bit of a mess, but in general the way it works in practice is that all the firmware builds directly pass CFLAGS\u003d... in which override all of this, and COMMON_FLAGS only really affect userland builds. For a firmware build, I don\u0027t think we want to risk a stray CPPFLAGS variable that was defined on the build host for some reason to suddenly start affecting firmware when it previously did not.",
