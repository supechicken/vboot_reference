      "message": "Not sure I understand this part. The recovery button (if it comes from the EC) is translated into \u0027\\r\u0027, but that\u0027s still not the same as BUTTON_POWER. (And I don\u0027t think that was a good idea either, tbh... it would be cleaner to make up a completely separate scancode and BUTTON_RECOVERY character for the recovery button as well. Maybe your overhaul would be a good opportunity to fix that too.)",
