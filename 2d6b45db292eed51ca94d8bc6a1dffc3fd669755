      "message": "nit: Joel, this might be too much to ask, but would it be possible to rename \"nbr\" to \"minios\"? because in all our codebase, I don\u0027t think we used \"nbr\" anywhere. It were all \"minios\". Also \"nbr\" could refer to many other things: https://source.corp.google.com/search?q\u003dnbr\u0026ss\u003dpiper%2FGoogle%2Fchromeos_public\nUsing minios would be easier when someone wants to do codesearch on it.",

I believe(?) \u0027R\u0027 (for Recovery) would still be available and doesn\u0027t move between keyboard layouts.",
