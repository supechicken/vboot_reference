      "message": "nit: All the casts not really necessary. (Depending on who you ask, pointer arithmetic on void * is either a terrible crime against humanity because a handful of  guys in 1989 didn\u0027t think far enough to see how useful it would be, or perfectly fine because the behavior is well-defined across all major compilers. Personally, I tend towards the second interpretation.)",
