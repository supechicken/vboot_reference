      "message": "Yeah, I was really surprised when the rubber stamper bot added a review.  I certainly didn\u0027t intend for that to happen, but since Joel had said in the bug that it was probably best to revert it, i didn\u0027t complain.\n\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/refs/heads/main/go/src/infra/appengine/rubber-stamper/README.md\n\nI\u0027m not entirely certain how the rubber stamper got added as a reviewer, because I didn\u0027t do anything that I thought would add it.  I didn\u0027t even know it existed until it gave the review.",
