I guess this was just a \u0027maybe\u0027 fix for Simon.\n\nCoreboot does make the variable in the env or at least seems to https://github.com/coreboot/coreboot/blob/b2287718ef2ab8051d917702185f91c33cb61aa3/src/security/vboot/Makefile.inc#L27 and so I wasn\u0027t sure what this build failure precisely looks like that was highlighted in the bug?\n\nI guess Simon can perhaps point out the precise problem exhibited in the out-of-tree build work flow he highlighted. I am sort of reading in between the lines here of the problem.\n\nIn any case, I am hopeful either here or coreboot is the right place to be looking to fix the general problem so we can move the discussion away from needing CLI or extra dependencies.",
