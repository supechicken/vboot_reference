      "message": "btw I just noticed that there\u0027s a device tree fixup in depthcharge which independently adds a `/firmware/android/verifiedbootstate` property to the device tree (`depthcharge/src/boot/android_dt.c`). That one is only dependent on `vboot_in_developer()` so it may be out of sync with this one. Is that a concern? Maybe we should have it find and scan `/chosen/bootargs` for the value in the command line instead so it will copy that faithfully in all cases.",
