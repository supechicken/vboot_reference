      "message": "btw I just noticed that there\u0027s a device tree fixup in depthcharge which independently adds a `/firmware/android/verifiedbootstate` property to the device tree (`depthcharge/src/boot/android_dt.c`). That one is only dependent on `vboot_in_developer()` so it may be out of sync with this one. Is that a concern? Maybe we should have it find and scan `/chosen/bootargs` for the value in the command line instead so it will copy that faithfully in all cases.",

      "message": "`android_dt.c` is compiled only if `ANDROID_DT_FIXUP` config is set. I was looking through defconfigs and depthcharge\u0027s overlay and it seems that nobody is setting that. If this file was in use, then I think we would have a problem with \"serialno\" property too, as it is set in `depthcharge/src/boot/android_bootconfig_params.c` from vpd, but in `android_dt.c` `lib_sysinfo` is used for that.\n\nWhat do you think about removing `android_dt.c`?",
