      "message": "The purpose of this CL is to make it tolerant to races, which we know result in EBUSY.  I am not sure that retrying for other errors makes it more robust, instead of just resulting in unexpected behavior (such as putting an error message in the logs 5 seconds later than expected).  Also, why check specifically for ENOENT?  Other similar errors will persist as well, such as EACCESS.",
