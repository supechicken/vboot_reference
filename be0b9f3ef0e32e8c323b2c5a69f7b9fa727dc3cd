But now you\u0027re trying to make it do something completely different, which is to operate on a directory that looks exactly like an unpacked shellball?\n\nI don\u0027t see how you could just take a `signer_config.csv` from somewhere, throw it into an unpacked `firmware_from_source` directory and make that work — the file names are all completely different. When you say \"modified\" do you mean that you completely rewrote the CSV (e.g. update all names from something like `bios-brya.ro-14505-761-0.rw-14505-761-0.bin` to `image-brya.bin`)? Or how would you make that fit together?\n\nI still don\u0027t get the whole point of what you\u0027re trying to do here (I thought you just wanted it to be able to sign a raw shellball without surrounding recovery image, but apparently it\u0027s not that). You\u0027re basically saying \"what if someone wanted to bypass the entire firmware packer and somehow assemble a vaguely comparable directory by hand and then sign it\" and I really don\u0027t see where that use case comes from, nor why we should allow it (and risk things getting out of sync every time something in the normal packer-\u003esigner flow changes). If you really have a raw `firmware_from_source` tarball and want to get it to a state where it could run through this script, I think it would make more sense for you to run `pack_firmware.py` manually and then feed the output of that into here (and for that use case we could consider adding a mode that takes a raw shellball), not try to redo the same steps and hack together the whole CSV and directory structure by hand.",

      "message": "+Hung-Te and +Yu-Ping who are more familiar with the firmware packer than I am.\n\nIf you want to MP-sign the output of a firmware build directly, you need (in addition to the images themselves from that build) the signing key ID and the brand code. Both of those need to come from cros-config (and we shouldn\u0027t try to introduce a second source of truth beside that, nor should we expect people to input them correctly by hand somehow). I believe(?) that cros-config is \"built\" as an ebuild and it\u0027s not possible to directly query it from sources (because it can come from multiple sources, including Boxster, and the \"building\" process is needed to figure out exactly which part comes from where). So if your goal is to have a firmware builder immediately MP-sign its output, I think that may be complicated in practice because the firmware builder runs on the firmware branch and the signing information needs to come from cros-config on ToT (for firmware branches it is generally not kept up to date). So I think your firmware builder would basically need to create a second chroot from ToT just to build the cros-config package and get the right signing information.\n\nI\u0027m also not sure that this is really a good idea in the first place. Firmware release is a process, there are a bunch of important steps and gates involved (e.g. firmware qualification / FAFT), and MP-signing is the final step once all the gates are passed. Having a firmware MP-signed _proves_ that all these gates have been passed and all those checks have been run, and other parts of the system may depend on that information — for example, the TPM rollback protection version roll-forward process only cares that it booted an MP-signed image with a certain rollback version and takes that as \"proof\" that this rollback version is now the new officially active one and all previous ones shall forever become invalid. It cannot tell whether that MP-signed image was actually officially released as part of a recovery image or just a firmware builder signing its own output. We also use changes to the officially pinned firmware version (in cros-config/Boxster) to track all the RO firmware versions that have ever been released for a certain board, to know all the versions that new RW updates may need to be tested against.\n\nSo if you start MP-signing things straight off the firmware builder and people actually start installing and using those images somewhere, it may cause the devices running those images to get out of sync and into unexpected states. Rollback protection versions may roll further forward than they\u0027re supposed to be from the current official releases. Devices may get RO firmware versions installed that are not officially supposed to be possible and may have hidden incompatibilities to new RW images that we didn\u0027t test for. Images with security-relevant bugs may get MP-signed and pose a risk if that image somehow leaks out into the wild even if firmware QA would have found that bug before the official release.\n\nIn short, if you don\u0027t really have a good reason to do so I\u0027d prefer we do not MP-sign any more images than the official process currently does. If we want to make it easier for people to download MP-signed images, I\u0027d recommend we integrate that into the existing process (e.g. make the builder that builds a recovery image also upload the raw firmware shellball as a release artifact in addition to the full recovery image), rather than doing it right on the firmware builder.",

What\u0027s the use case of that? Do we need to support firmware archives (built from firmware branch) for *all* the existing platforms, or just future platforms?\n\n\u003e jwerner@: If you want to MP-sign the output of a firmware build directly, you need (in addition to the images themselves from that build) the signing key ID and the brand code.\n\nYes, I agree that signer_config.csv should be the single source of truth of `key_id` and `brand_code`. In b/230679721, we added signer_config.csv to `${SYSROOT}/firmware/`, in order to have better support for firmware provisioning in the lab. Therefore, for recent platforms (starting from corsola), signer_config.csv should exist in the firmware archive built from the firmware branch. However, as Julius said, one major problem is that the `key_id` and `brand_code` may out of sync from the ToT. When enabling a new project from an existing program, we usually don\u0027t cherry-pick all the Boxster config CLs to the firmware branch (for example CL:\\*5320710 and CL:\\*5071069 are missing in corsola firmware branch). Also, the cost of maintaining firmware branch\u0027s signer_config.csv seems pretty high. Therefore, the only option I can think of is to pull in either signer_config.csv or config.yaml from ToT build.\n\n\u003e jwerner@: I\u0027d recommend we integrate that into the existing process (e.g. make the builder that builds a recovery image also upload the raw firmware shellball as a release artifact in addition to the full recovery image), rather than doing it right on the firmware builder.\n\n+1. This is somewhat related to b/335446974, where we plan to create a new build artifact pinned_firmware.tar.bz2 (where the directory layout is the same as firmware.tar.bz2, but only contains AP and EC images). It\u0027d be easy to add signer_config.csv to that artifact.",
