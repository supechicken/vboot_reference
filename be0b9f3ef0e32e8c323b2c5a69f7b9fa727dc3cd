      "message": "Note that as far as I\u0027m aware nothing is calling this script with the \"firmware\" type to begin with (I wouldn\u0027t have high confidence that that signing mode still works correctly at all). LOEM support is correctly implemented for the \"recovery\" type which is how all our firmware actually gets signed in practice. So I\u0027m not opposed to you fixing this if you want to, but it\u0027s not really relevant to what we\u0027re actually using.",

I think just something like `[[ -e \"${firmware_dir}/models/guybrush\" ]]` or `grep Google_Guybrush \"${firmware_dir}/VERSION\"` should probably do the trick.",
