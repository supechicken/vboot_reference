      "message": "For the signature size part, I agree that we should use sig_alg to determine the signature size instead of restoring it and we should determine the sig_alg based on CKA_MODULUS_BITS and CKA_PUBLIC_EXPONENT. But on the other hand, I would prefer not to pass vb2_private_key to this file. I think passing pkcs11_key with some additional information (e.g. signature_size) to the functions should be enough and clean.",
