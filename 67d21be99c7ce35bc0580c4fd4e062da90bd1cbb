I only just noticed this sneak past.\n\nThere is also no bug or any other context as well nor much review or design here on how we are going to actually maintain this.\n\nFurthermore it unwinds a lot of work to get the flashrom coupling code in one place under flashrom_drv and out of futility itself. If we want to have multiple backends we need to have that implemented within flashrom_drv.c",

      "message": "I will maintain this since it is inside the updater itself.\n\nI didn\u0027t change the flashrom_drv interfaces - you can still keep revising flashrom_drv to make it better integrated. Please consider this as a debug/workaround (as the name in next CL said, it\u0027s triggered only by a quirk) because I do need it when people reported updater failure. It\u0027s important to have something that can be used to compare libflashrom and real flashrom.",
