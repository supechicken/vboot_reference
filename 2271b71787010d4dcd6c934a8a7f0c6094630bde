      "message": "Is this really a problem with FreeBSD or is it just that you test system doesn\u0027t have libuuid installed? Some googling suggests libuuid can exist on FreeBSD (e.g. https://www.freshports.org/misc/e2fsprogs-libuuid/), so then there\u0027s no real reason to exclude this based on OS here.\n\nIf you want to write this such that libuuid is optional for vboot and it will fall back to using hardcoded UUIDs when that\u0027s not available, I\u0027m okay with that too but then the check needs to be written differently... probably using pkgconfig or something to detect the library, not just basing it off the OS.",
