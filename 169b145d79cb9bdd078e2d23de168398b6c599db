      "message": "No, but the normal src_compile() of the vboot_reference ebuild does a `make all`, and for vboot_reference the `all` target includes fuzzers. So it will not *run* the fuzzers (that wouldn\u0027t really make sense either, I think), but it should build them. I\u0027m confused why it didn\u0027t (we recently added a $(filter clang,${CC}) in there to solve compatibility issues for upstream users in CL:2382790, maybe that doesn\u0027t work as intended?).",
