      "message": "This looks a bit weird but since it\u0027s only a backport I guess it\u0027s fine (and probably better than trying to do larger refactoring here). On ToT I think we may want to consider getting rid of `GetCurrentKernelUniqueGuid()` and open-coding the `memcpy()` instead, since it\u0027s weird that some accesses to the same entry work on the `entry` pointer and some imply it through `gpt.current_kernel`.",
