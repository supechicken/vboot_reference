      "message": "The current design of vboot UI code is to have vb2ex_display_ui only called from ui_loop.  Otherwise there are some tricky edge cases to think about -- e.g. when switching to a new screen, we need to ensure that its init function is called before drawing it the first time.  Or in this case, if vb2_screen_state changed in between error_action and the next vb2ex_display_ui call in ui_loop, the error dialog would disappear almost immediately.\n\nI\u0027d suggest storing error_msg as part of ui_context, and using the vb2ex_display_ui call in ui_loop to send the error message to depthcharge.",
