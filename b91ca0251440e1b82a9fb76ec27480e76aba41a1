      "message": "Not sure I like this version of the renaming tbh, I don\u0027t think \"Sysfs\" really communicates the restrictions well, and it doesn\u0027t seem necessary to discourage usage of these functions in other cases where they would apply as well. It\u0027s not like all sysfs files are only one line anyway (e.g. uevent files have multiple lines).\n\nI think ReadFileInt and ReadFileBit make sense as they are, since they imply that the entire file can be interpreted as an integer which implies it not having newlines. For ReadFileString I would still suggest something closer to what I had suggested in the other thread (e.g. ReadFileLine or ReadFileFirstLine or something like that).",
