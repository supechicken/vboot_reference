      "message": "You don\u0027t have the `GetEntrySuccessful()` check at all now, that\u0027s a clear sign that there\u0027s a problem here. The issue with this version (unlike the Nissa one) is that updating the kernel version is done automatically by later code (`vb2_normal_boot()` in `2lib/2kernel.c`), it\u0027s not explicitly triggered from here, and it always rolls forward to whatever `sd-\u003ekernel_version` is set to. So if we just let `vb2_verify_kernel_vblock()` set `sd-\u003ekernel_version` and then never touch it again, we would roll forward even if the slot is not marked successful yet. The older code would ensure with the `lowest_version` thing that `sd-\u003ekernel_version` was always set to what the lowest slot had, so this was still okay, but now that we only look at one slot it is not anymore.\n\nI can think of a number of options to solve this but none of them are super clean. One is to just store `sd-\u003ekernel_version` at the start of `LoadKernel()` in a local variable and then restore it to whatever it was at the end if the slot was not successful. The other is to change the implementation of `vb2_load_partition()`/`vb2_verify_kernel_vblock()` similar to what we have on ToT now, that they have an extra `*kernel_version` out pointer argument and don\u0027t write to `sd-\u003ekernel_version` directly anymore (and then have `LoadKernel()` set `sd-\u003ekernel_version` at the end if needed).\n\nI think the latter is probably the better one?\n\n(Also, are there no tests you need to modify in this branch?)",

      "message": "I think that the simplest solution is to break from the main loop when we boot from a successful entry. In that case we take another kernel version into the consideration only when trying a new kernel, otherwise we ignore it. Please let me know what you think about the v2 patch. I hope I did not miss anything.",
