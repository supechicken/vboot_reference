      "message": "nit: Would be good to make it a bit clearer that this is an OUT-flag which instructs the caller to do something (as opposed to the caller requesting vboot to do something), e.g. \"If this is set after kernel verification, caller should disable the TPM before jumping to kernel.\"\n\n(One of these days it would be nice if we could make the difference between IN- and OUT-flags here more explicit, e.g. by renaming them all to VB2_CONTEXT_IN_... and VB2_CONTEXT_OUT_... or the like. And clean up cases where the documentation here doesn\u0027t match reality anymore, like with CLEAR_RAM.)",

      "message": "Done.\n\n\u003e IN- and OUT-flags\n\nActually I had the same thought when I first looked at this code. However, the in/out type might change over time (for example with vboot refactoring), and we\u0027d need to rename the flag, which is bothersome. Also note that some flags might be both IN- and OUT- (for example `VB2_CONTEXT_DISPLAY_INIT`).",

However, because both `VbTryLoadKernel` and `VbTryLoadMiniOsKernel` might be called multiple times, it\u0027d be nice to clear the flag just in case depthcharge calls `VbTryLoadKernel` after a successful `VbTryLoadMiniOsKernel` call (for example if we decided to check miniOS availability without actually booting into it).",
