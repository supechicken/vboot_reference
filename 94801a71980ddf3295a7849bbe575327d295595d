Also, digging up some history on this, it looks like it was done intentionally: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/vboot_reference/+/1197022\n\nFrom the commit description it looks like we are relying on flashrom behavior to skip SI_ME when the ME region is locked. However, I think there should not be any harm in ensuring that both descriptor and ME regions are preserved. Did you check if all boards (including older boards) have SI_ALL defined as SI_ME + SI_DESC?\n\nAlso, adding Hung-Te here to get inputs from him.",
