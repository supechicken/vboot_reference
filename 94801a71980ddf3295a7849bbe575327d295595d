      "message": "If this is being changed, I think we should do that as a separate CL. Also, digging up some history on this, it looks like it was done intentionally: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/vboot_reference/+/1197022\n\nFrom the commit description it looks like we are relying on flashrom behavior to skip SI_ME when the ME region is locked. However, I think there should not be any harm in ensuring that both descriptor and ME regions are preserved. Did you check if all boards (including older boards) have SI_ALL defined as SI_ME + SI_DESC?\n\nAlso, adding Hung-Te here to get inputs from him.",

      "message": "I think thing can be identified by flashrom should keep there. The reason we add SI_DESC is for locked section, flashrom will handle SI_ME internally \n but it won\u0027t know how to deal with the attributes in SI_DESC. And in fact no matter if you \"preserve\" in futility updater or not, that does not make any difference given flashrom can\u0027t read SI_ME (for comparison).\n\nLike Furquan said, there\u0027s no promise SI_ALL means SI_ME + SI_DESC. In fact on deltaur SI_ALL \u003d SI_DESC, SI_EC, SI_ME and SI_PDR, and on sarien that even includes SI_GBE.",
