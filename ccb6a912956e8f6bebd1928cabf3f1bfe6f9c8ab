      "message": "Well, this would have to be uname-guarded, if anything.\n\nDoes FreeBSD not support pkg-config? I found https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query\u003dpkgconf\u0026sektion\u003d1\u0026manpath\u003dfreebsd-release-ports which looks like the right thing, except that the executable seems to be called pkgconf instead of pkg-config (probably because pkg-config clashes with the FreeBSD-specific \u0027pkg\u0027 tool). So maybe all you need to do is setting PKG_CONFIG to `pkgconf` in like 266 (based on uname)? The whole point of the pkg-config tool is that it abstracts all these sort of platform-specific details of library linking away, so it sounds like something we would want to use especially for this case.",
