      "message": "I found this feature useful to test CL:3575325.\nIn mentioned CL we re making `futility sign` able to sign images with only RW/A region (so `FW_MAIN_A `and `VBLOCK_A`). To test new cases I had to provide an image without `FW_MAIN_B` and `VBLOCK_B`. I found it easier to add command like this and then use it in `futility  sign` tests, than to modify coreboot (and friends) to compile image with RW/A only.",
