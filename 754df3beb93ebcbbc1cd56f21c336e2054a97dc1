      "message": "I think there are two reasonable ways we can move forward with this struct. One would be to add the ec_hash[] *behind* the CRC so that it would be fully backwards-compatible, which would make it easier for code that needs to support both versions. The other would be to rearrange everything, which allows us to fix some of the bad design choices in the original struct (e.g. misaligned members, and then we would probably also add a \u0027size\u0027 field and move the CRC closer to the top like for FWMP). Not quite sure which option is better.",
