      "message": "I think this one should remain ERROR. When your FMAP doesn\u0027t have either VBLOCK_B or FW_MAIN_B, then you clearly don\u0027t want to have a slot B and that\u0027s fine (and then this function would have returned further up). But if you do have FW_MAIN_B but you don\u0027t have VBLOCK_B, you messed up and we should call that an error, because that combination makes no sense. Either you have the slot completely or not at all.",

      "message": "Sorry, I\u0027m not sure where this came from, why are we changing the logic here? It\u0027s intentional that we only want to call get_metadata_hash() when uses_cbfs_integration is true. (Now you made it so that it would also get called if that was false and the truncate failed. I mean it would probably just fail and do nothing, but that still sounds wrong. Note that truncate failing is not an error, that just means we\u0027re signing a non-coreboot image which is a legal use case.)",
