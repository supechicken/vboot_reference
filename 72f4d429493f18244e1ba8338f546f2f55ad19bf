      "message": "This is not the first time people proposed to auto-format vboot code (b/243397848). As I said on the bug, the vboot_reference repo follows coreboot\u0027s style. However there hasn\u0027t been consensus about auto-formatting code there in upstream coreboot. See the previous (long) [discussions](https://mail.coreboot.org/hyperkitty/list/coreboot@coreboot.org/thread/4FAD25MJPI2XSSWHDDI5CSJR6SKCRFWW/#FDPB2PVVV7AB2CPJSGX4S2SFA4WNURN4).\n\nIn addition, hypothetically, if we\u0027d like to enable this pre-submit check, there should be CLs fixing all files in the repo (just like CL:3751462 for ec).\n\nPersonally I think it\u0027s usually good to run clang-format on a CL before uploading it for review, in order to reduce the reviewing effort. However, before enforcing the format, we have to make sure people agree on the clang-format\u0027s output (with the current config).",

      "message": "I\u0027m easy, I now know from my review to run clang-format manually in vboot_reference patches (add it to the list of custom rules for each repo!). I thought it may have been an oversight that it had not been added here. \n\nI will say it is fairly normal in my experience to ignore the repo upload hooks when you disagree with them, but I know some people are very uncomfortable with that, and its not friendly to new contributors (like finding out which tool to run manually).\n\nJulius can re-open if he wants of course",
