      "message": "Sorry, I misunderstood how this test works. These are all disks that are provided to a single VbTryLoadKernel() invocation, so there should be only one correct choice. To test the other options you\u0027ll have to add a full new entry to the outermost test[] array.\n\n(Also, the EXTERNAL_GPT thing is something that was never really used anywhere and that normal Chromebooks don\u0027t have. It\u0027s more important to test the normal cases without it.)",
