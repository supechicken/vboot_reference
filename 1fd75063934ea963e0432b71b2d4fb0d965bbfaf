      "message": "So, wait, all you need to get this out of the binary is look at the FMAP? I thought it was a much more complicated extraction process than that.\n\nI\u0027m honestly not sure I understand the point of putting it in a separate CBFS file in that case, then. I don\u0027t think that\u0027s considerably \"easier\" than just dumping the FMAP section off the EC binary, at least not enough to warrant the redundancy. I mean, if you have a ROM image and you want to get this version out, then even if it\u0027s in a CBFS file you still need to at least run a cbfstool command to extract it. cbfstool even has an FMAP parser integrated in itself already, so it\u0027s not even about avoiding an extra dependency on dump_fmap (which is pretty much always available wherever we have cbfstool anyway). The entire difference between the two is just whether you need to invoke cbfstool once\n```\ncbfstool image.bin extract -n ecrw.version -f version\n```\nor twice\n```\ncbfstool image.bin extract -n ecrw -f ${TMPFILE}\ncbfstool ${TMPFILE} read -r RW_FWID -f version\n```\nIs that really worth the hassle (and the risk that the CBFS file could get out of sync)?",
