      "message": "I honestly don\u0027t think removing this is an improvement. I think this enum did a good job clarifying that \"developer boot\" is not the same as \"developer switch set\" and the two need to be carefully distinguished. You now replaced this with individual checks like (dev_mode \u0026\u0026 !rec_mode) but that feels less clear and more prone to mistakes to me (like I\u0027d say you already made one in require_official_os() even though that wasn\u0027t the last line of defense for that case). I think being able to check \"this is a developer *boot*\" in one go without having to open code the details of how rec_mode and dev_mode interact with each other every time is useful.",
