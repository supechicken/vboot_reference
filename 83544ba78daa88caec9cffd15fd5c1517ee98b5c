      "message": "This is not the only problem we have. The other caller of `get_keyblock` from `get_key_versions` will also potentially set the preamble pointer to a too large value (even outside the data buffer in memory). Therefore I think  it\u0027s better to call `vb2_check_keyblock` in `get_keyblock`.\n\nWe also have a similar check `futil_valid_gbb_header` in `find_gbb`, so doing the check in `get_keyblock` seems consistent with that.",
