      "message": "This is actually introducing a very serious bug.  This screen action function is called once on every ui_loop() iteration.  Now that you\u0027re including the keyboard logic within this call (under vb2_confirm_physical_presence), the user may press *any* trusted key, and the device will transition to developer mode.  Even if we add a check for the ENTER key, a transition will still occur when focused on the \"Cancel\" button.",
