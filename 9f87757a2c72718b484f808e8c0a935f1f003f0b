      "message": "The documentation for VB2_SECDATA_KERNEL_FLAG_HWCRYPTO_ALLOWED also needs updating.\n\nCorrect me if I\u0027m missing something, but:\n\n* Previously, we can push a RW update which sets the DISALLOW_HWCRYPTO flag in the preamble, which stops hardware acceleration starting from before RW validation *on the first run* of new RW.\n\n* Now, when we push a RW update, the first run of new RW will still use hardware acceleration.  The secdata_kernel hwcrypto_allowed flag is only updated when RW code is reached.  Subsequent RW validation will not use hardware acceleration.\n\nMaybe this is unimportant -- if we find a bug in hardware crypto, it won\u0027t make a difference to use it one more time before disabling?  Regardless, I think we should explicitly point out that there is a change in behaviour here.",
