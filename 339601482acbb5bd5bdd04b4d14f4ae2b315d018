      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I agree with this... \"altfw\" is the official internal/in-code name of the feature, and we\u0027ve hardcoded it in some places we can\u0027t change anymore like the CBFS filenames. I\u0027m okay with harmonizing any user-visible language (to \"alternate bootloader\"), but I think we should stick with altfw in the code (especially if you\u0027re just gonna call it \"bootloader\" instead, which I think is very confusing without an \"alt\" anywhere).",

How can we standardize these in a reasonable way?\n\naltfw: used internally in code, filenames, and CBFS filenames\n\nlegacy boot: used internally in code and filenames (including vboot API); used in external-facing documentation, and also widely used in non-official Chrome OS resources\n\nAlternate Boot: used in vboot API, Groot code, and user-facing Groot UI",
