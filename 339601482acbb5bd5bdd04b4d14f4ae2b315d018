      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I agree with this... \"altfw\" is the official internal/in-code name of the feature, and we\u0027ve hardcoded it in some places we can\u0027t change anymore like the CBFS filenames. I\u0027m okay with harmonizing any user-visible language (to \"alternate bootloader\"), but I think we should stick with altfw in the code (especially if you\u0027re just gonna call it \"bootloader\" instead, which I think is very confusing without an \"alt\" anywhere).",

      "message": "I\u0027m okay with getting rid of \"legacy boot\" where you can. For example, we could just have crossystem alias dev_boot_altfw to dev_boot_legacy (i.e. the old name should still work when explicitly trying to set it, but it should use the new name in the list). I think it\u0027s fine if the feature uses \"altfw\" as the short internal name for APIs and such but is written out fully as \"alternate bootloader\" in UI and documentation (and then let\u0027s please make that consistent, just saying \"bootloader\" or \"alternate boot\" or whatever is not the same thing and risks confusing people).",

      "message": "Okay -- take another look and let me know what you think.\n\nThere\u0027s some other \"legacy boot\" stuff in CGPT code, but that seems to be something different.  I also left a crossystem alias as you requested.\n\nAlso, I largely left the UI code untouched.  Should we leave the code to reflect the wording of the screens themselves, or should we also convert those to read \"altfw\" behind-the-scenes?",
