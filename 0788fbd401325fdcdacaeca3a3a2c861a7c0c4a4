      "message": "From CL:6892551 `vb2ex_factory_data_reset` will return error when booting from external disk. Please correct me if I am wrong, but it will break flow where developer is using external disk and switches DUT from normal to developer mode. There is required extra boot from internal drive. If image on internal drive is unbootable then we need to fix it in the first place (either from fastboot or by switching back to normal mode and performing recovery).\n\nI don\u0027t know if that scenario is common, but if we decide to break that flow at lest do it intentionally.",
