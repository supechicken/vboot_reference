      "message": "I am not sure what you mean by \"usage() functions.\" Do you mean the help text that is printed out when you run futility help?\n\nIf so, I would prefer to maintain this markdown documentation for the help text. \n\nThis would be more helpful when rewriting documents that misuse those tools. For example, some documents use flashrom but do not mention that it will erase VPD/HWID. It would be clearer and easier to minimally edit those sections and add a link to this document than to copy and paste the correct usage repeatedly.\n\nHowever, I think it is still a good idea to have a minimal set of text printed out by futility help. This would be helpful for users who just need a quick reference for the most common commands.",

      "message": "Yes, I mean functions like print_help() in cmd_gbb_utility.c (in many programs that kind of function is called usage(), I guess not in futility). We definitely need to keep that and it needs to remain comprehensive. In many cases users only have the utility itself available at the time they\u0027re trying to get help and not some README file that was included in the source repo. I understand your desire to have command documentation with better formatting options available to link to, but that can\u0027t fully replace the command\u0027s integrated help. (I\u0027m not sure if there\u0027s a way to have the same text both included in futility as help text and also available as an extra file to link to? We definitely can\u0027t ship an entire markdown parser with futility, though.)\n\nAgain, not saying I\u0027m against this patch. I think in practice this is what most e.g. GNU utilities end up doing (having a man page and a built-in usage() function that are fully separate) because there\u0027s not really a better option in practice. I\u0027m just saying that I doubt people will always remember to update this as things change. (Maybe adding a comment in the print_help() functions to remind people could help.)",
