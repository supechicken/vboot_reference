Otherwise I think it might be better to not produce the file by default and add a new option like `--ecrw_out \u003cfilename\u003e` or something like that to allow specifying where it should go. (Writing out to a hardcoded file name in the current directory is generally a terrible pattern that would be good to get rid of.)",
