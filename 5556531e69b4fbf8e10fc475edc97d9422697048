      "message": "Julius thought we should:\n\n\u003e Please implement it for all sub-forms of show, for consistency. (Note that many are not implemented in this file but in the individual file type files, e.g. file_type_bios.c.)\n\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s worth the effort given that a large amount of code needs to be modified, and that we have only one use case atm. The only thing I care is that futility should exit with an error if `-P` is passed for an unsupported type.",
