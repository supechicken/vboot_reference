Better to just rip the band aid and get over this hill. There is no perfect mechanism in ChromeOS to do this sort of thing, a lot of these docs for example are duplicates and really should just be deleted.

      "message": "We are working with a lot of partners, and now you are removing a command that many partners have get used to, trained for, had many local scripts using them, and the cost of communication with partners is large - we need to spend time dealing with each of them, figuring out their code branch and situation, make fixes for the old branches if needed.\n\nSo I\u0027d prefer a longer transition time - update all the internal docs and programs calling these scripts, make sure no one is using them for a several milestones, before we really really drop the files. \n\n\u003e They just distract and provide a maintenance burden\n\nI don\u0027t see why it is a maintenance burden. The script has been there for a very very long time, and its usage / syntax was very clear and stable. The right way is to make a good wrapper to build a smooth transition, not killing it and force everyone to move to a different command.",
