      "message": "We are working with a lot of partners, and now you are removing a command that many partners have get used to, trained for, had many local scripts using them, and the cost of communication with partners is large - we need to spend time dealing with each of them, figuring out their code branch and situation, make fixes for the old branches if needed.\n\nSo I\u0027d prefer a longer transition time - update all the internal docs and programs calling these scripts, make sure no one is using them for a several milestones, before we really really drop the files. \n\n\u003e They just distract and provide a maintenance burden\n\nI don\u0027t see why it is a maintenance burden. The script has been there for a very very long time, and its usage / syntax was very clear and stable. The right way is to make a good wrapper to build a smooth transition, not killing it and force everyone to move to a different command.",

In addition, before removing the scripts there should be PSA sent to the entire ChromeOS team (I don\u0027t remember seeing it, did we already announce that?).\n\n\u003e Also, it was a shortcut for many partners with simpler command syntax.\n\nRegarding that, I wonder if we can drop `--flash` when running on DUT. If no servo-related options (--servo, --ccd) are specified, futility may assume it is running on DUT.",
