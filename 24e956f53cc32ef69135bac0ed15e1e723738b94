      "message": "Was this (BRANCH\u003dnone) discussed some where? It would be great if there\u0027s a bug officially explaining why we make the change. Firmware was one of the repo that compatibility matters and that\u0027s why BRANCH is important.\n\nI\u0027m fine if we\u0027re changing BRANCH to be optional, but it\u0027ll be great to make sure this is aligned by the fw team.\n\n+Julius to review for +2.",
