So we are not logging these operations on workstations nor builders.\n2. We just log all parameters passed to the script before line 66.  Or, we log the operations / parameters in `resign_ssd_kernel` function.  So the logs are not limited to disable_rootfs_verification.",

I think it is valid, we don\u0027t really want to spam the syslog on people\u0027s workstations (is the logger utility even available there?).",
