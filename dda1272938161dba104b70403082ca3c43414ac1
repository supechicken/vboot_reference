So we are not logging these operations on workstations nor builders.\n2. We just log all parameters passed to the script before line 66.  Or, we log the operations / parameters in `resign_ssd_kernel` function.  So the logs are not limited to disable_rootfs_verification.",

The `logger` tool should be available when syslog is used.\n\nBut..., I\u0027m not sure if the builder logs include syslog or not.  If not, we can add some `if` statements to only log it when `ROOTDEV_DISK` is used.",
