The goal here is not to serialize this full data block, it is to make it as easy as possible for any other process (written in anything, even in environments with restricted dependencies) to parse a few individual fields they may try to query. I think this format is a good solution because it easily allows you to extract any field with just a grep+cut or a simple regex match. We just need to fine-tune the individual field names to have more regularity (see my other comments), and then of course there should be an understanding that once a field has been added, it needs to be supported indefinitely (or at least deprecated very carefully).",

I don\u0027t think futility has a case where that\u0027s really going to be a problem, but maybe I\u0027m wrong and then we can discuss it when we see it. We\u0027re not trying to design a universal data serialization format here, after all, just something that can output what futility needs to output.\n\n\u003e Another option might be to allow printing each individual piece like:\n\nYeah, I thought about that option too, that would be the next best alternative. That gets a lot more complicated inside futility itself though, since you can no longer just run through the same code that the human-readable `show` runs through and just modify the print statements, you now have to implement a full parser for all valid input indentifiers and then figure out for each of them exactly what data structures you need to unpack to get to that answer. Ultimately, since runtime isn\u0027t really important for this feature (so we don\u0027t really care about wasting time printing \"too much\") and since basically every caller ever no matter what it is written in should be easily able to do the equivalent of a grep and cut, I don\u0027t think we gain anything there that\u0027s worth the extra effort, and I think the solution implemented here is still the best combination of easy to implement and useful for all expected use cases.",
