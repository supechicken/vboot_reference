      "message": "this is about consistency between test and prod key names.\n\nthis patch https://crrev.com/i/4983258  added code for generating prod keys for AP RO verification. The root key is created by the HSM and as such its file name has a prefix of `root_key_`. \n\nI think we should keep the names consistent across dev and prod key sets, this was one of the original patch reviewer\u0027s requests, he is on a long break now, so can\u0027t pitch in into this discussion at this time.",

      "message": "You cannot CQ-Depend on upstream coreboot patches. In order to land a circular dependency with coreboot, you\u0027d have to first land this in the downstream ChromiumOS mirror of the coreboot repository (where you can use Cq-Depend), and then after than and the vboot patch have landed submit an upstream coreboot patch that also updates the vboot submodule at the same time (like I did in CL:3854282 / CL:3831332 / CB:66561).\n\nIt\u0027s a pretty complicated process, unfortunately. Do we really have to change the name of this file? I don\u0027t understand what\u0027s better about the new name, it just seems inconsistent that the root key is now called \"root_key_arv_root\" and the corresponding platform key is still just called \"arv_platform\".",
