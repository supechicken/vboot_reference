      "message": "\u003e Does this mean that if the AP does ask the EC to jump...\n\nyes. So, this whole idea works under the assumption that AP-RO and EC-RO behave as expected in recovery mode. AP-RO can ask EC to jump in non-recovery context and that\u0027s not a problem.\n\n\u003e I would feel better if the EC could guarantee ...\n\nAgree. (1) We can make the EC lock down sysjump once it registers MANUAL_RECOVERY with the AP. It\u0027s probably a good idea to enforce it by code instead of by documentation.\n\nIn non-recovery context, it\u0027s tricky. If EC fails to talk to GSC for some reason, it may jump to RW upon AP\u0027s request (legacy path). (2) We can make the AP clear VB2_CONTEXT_EC_IN_RO after sending a sysjump request. \n\n1 and 2 should make the signal more robust. WDYT?",
