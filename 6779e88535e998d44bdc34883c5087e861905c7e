      "message": "You\u0027re now printing this every time when someone boots a self-signed kernel in developer mode on a rolled-forward system, which we probably don\u0027t want. I think it makes sense to just skip this check entirely when !need_keyblock_valid. There seems little reason why we\u0027d care to check this in developer mode if we\u0027re not gonna do anything about it anyway.",
