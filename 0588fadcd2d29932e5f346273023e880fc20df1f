I\u0027m also not super sure this needs a wrapper in the first place (vs being able to see exactly what it does in the caller without having to dig, which can sometimes also be a readability benefit).",

      "message": "I guess not committing here is okay because in practice having a recovery request always means we\u0027re in non-manual recovery mode, and we do another commit before displaying the screen there. But might be worth pointing that out explicitly in a comment. (There is some edge-case weirdness when you set a recovery request somehow but then press Esc+Refresh+Power rather than rebooting automatically and then press Refresh+Power on the recovery screen. Also when VB2_GBB_FLAG_FORCE_MANUAL_RECOVERY is set. But I think those are far out enough that we don\u0027t need to worry about them.)",
