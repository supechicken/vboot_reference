That\u0027s not what I meant.\n\nThe goal of the infinite loop is to make sure vboot cannot continue *even if* the calling firmware implements vb2ex_abort() with something that violates the contract (i.e. returns). So you can\u0027t have it here, you need it in the macro.\n\nThis here is the stub that is compiled into any userland code (e.g. futility or tests). It never gets compiled for firmware builds. So here you can call your exit(1). Since it\u0027s weak, tests can still override it if they desire.",
