How are you going to create the NOR and NAND images needed for the factory images without first booting and running on the target system?\n\nIt seems like we\u0027ll want to run \"cgpt -c \" with some args on the build system first, which would emit the GPT header image for the NOR flash along with the raw disk image for the NAND flash.",
