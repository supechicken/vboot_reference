      "message": "There are a number of parameters which are still useful when run as a normal user.  For example, `crossystem arch`.\n\nSuggest making this a warning rather than an error.  That will also let you commit this change now, without worrying about what you\u0027re breaking.",

      "message": "Great suggestions.  One thing I would like to ask is when we run crossystem as a non-root user, is what we see really a limited functionality by design or whatever works on the given environment?  (e.g. x86 or arm)  Nobody knows how this command will be used in the future, so shouldn\u0027t be make the behavior more consistent across the platforms?",
