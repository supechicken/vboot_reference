      "message": "off-topic, but this sounds like a bad feature that we should remove (I actually never knew this was in here, and I doubt anyone is ever using this). /tmp tends to be world writable so anyone can put a symlink to `/etc/passwd` or whatever there and trick the next futility process running as root to trample over important files. This sort of thing is a classic security red flag.",

I checked the implementation and it seems there is no way to directly call recursive `mkdir` implementation, so this has to stay as it is now.",
