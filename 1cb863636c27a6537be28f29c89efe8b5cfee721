      "message": "Why would we want to return an error from the whole command here? I think we should just output what we can about the keyblock/preamble without making a judgement on body verification (i.e. run into the \"Seems legit, but the signature is unverified\" path below). This has always been this way and CBFS integration shouldn\u0027t have made a difference for that anyway, because when you just give it a raw vblock to verify then it never had a firmware body to check the body signature against, even in the old model.",
