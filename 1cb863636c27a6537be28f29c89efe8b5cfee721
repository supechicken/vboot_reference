      "message": "Why would we want to return an error from the whole command here? I think we should just output what we can about the keyblock/preamble without making a judgement on body verification (i.e. run into the \"Seems legit, but the signature is unverified\" path below). This has always been this way and CBFS integration shouldn\u0027t have made a difference for that anyway, because when you just give it a raw vblock to verify then it never had a firmware body to check the body signature against, even in the old model.",

When the input file is a vblock with no `--fv` specified, this function will return in line #396 above.\n\nHowever now I agree that this shouldn\u0027t be a FATAL error, and should return 1 only if `show_option.strict`.",
