      "message": "This might work for this bug, but I don\u0027t think it will be a sufficient solution in the long run. We have cases where the TPM should still be \"unlocked\" in userland (when booting in recovery mode), and tpmc read and write still need to work fine in that case.\n\nIf possible, I think the best solution would be to detect the platform hierarchy setting dynamically.",

      "message": "Completely agree. But it requires further investigation, as in my experiments \u0027tpmc read\u0027 succeeded with both PH enabled and disabled. The problem was seen only in fw. So, will file a bug to investigate, but with a lower prio.",
