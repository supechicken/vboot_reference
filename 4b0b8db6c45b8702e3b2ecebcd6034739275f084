      "message": "Yeah, with vboot2 we have started using more C standard library functions directly again, when they are really common and their behavior is really universal. I\u0027m not sure if I want to go back on that trend, because if you go all the way to the other extreme you have things like vb2ex_memset() and vb2_uint32_t everywhere, and I don\u0027t think we want that sort of clutter either.\n\nCan you not just solve this on the caller side instead? You can make a special include directory specifically for vboot system headers, that you put in the include path in front of everything else in the CFLAGS specific to vboot. And there you can have a stub \u003cstdlib.h\u003e that both includes the real stblib.h (e.g. through \"../../real/path/stdlib.h\") and defines a macro for malloc that does whatever special thing you want it to do. If you already have a conforming malloc() prototype in stdlib and you just don\u0027t want to use that function for vboot, you can also pass a --wrap LDFLAG to vboot, or objcopy the output library with --redefine-sym.",
