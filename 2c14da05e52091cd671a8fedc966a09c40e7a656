      "message": "The Android code is under Apache license. It\u0027s compatible with the BSC license that the vboot project is under. Therefore I think we could add the `system/tools/mkbootimg` repo to the chromiumos manifest.\n\n@jwerner@chromium.org I wonder if we could keep this file here under Apache license. There is no requirement for all the code in vboot_reference to be BSD, right?",

      "message": "@korneld@google.com\n\nActually, I just recalled that Apache 2.0 is not compatible with GPLv2, which leaves us few options:\n\n1. Rewrite the struct definition by ourselves, so that we can have whatever license we want. This option is easier, but with higher risks.\n2. Ask the upstream to re-license it to something like `Apache OR BSD`. I haven\u0027t checked if BSD is allowed in AOSP. The contributors of the header file are all googlers except 2 `@android.com` and 1 `@intel.com`.",
