      "message": "The Android code is under Apache license. It\u0027s compatible with the BSC license that the vboot project is under. Therefore I think we could add the `system/tools/mkbootimg` repo to the chromiumos manifest.\n\n@jwerner@chromium.org I wonder if we could keep this file here under Apache license. There is no requirement for all the code in vboot_reference to be BSD, right?",

      "message": "@korneld@google.com\n\nActually, I just recalled that Apache 2.0 is not compatible with GPLv2, which leaves us few options:\n\n1. Rewrite the struct definition by ourselves, so that we can have whatever license we want. This option is easier, but with higher risks.\n2. Ask the upstream to re-license it to something like `Apache OR BSD`. I haven\u0027t checked if BSD is allowed in AOSP. The contributors of the header file are all googlers except 2 `@android.com` and 1 `@intel.com`.",

      "message": "BSD is compatible with Apache but not the other way round. We cannot redistribute an Apache file as BSD.\n\nWe shouldn\u0027t be the first ones that have this problem, there are other GPL bootloaders out there that Android vendors have already been using for years. For example, U-Boot has most of this here: https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/blob/master/include/android_image.h (Oddly, Android themselves hosts an outdated BSD version of this file here: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bootable/bootloader/legacy/+/b1fde5cd7d5158b8e6876139ca76a341d0e49708/include/boot/bootimg.h.)\n\nAndroid should have a CLA so they should have the rights to relicense this however they want. I would suggest to start an email thread with opensource-licensing@ and whatever team owns this on the Android side and just ask if we can relicense this to BSD.",
