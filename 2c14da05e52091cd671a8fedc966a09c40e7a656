Therefore I think we could add the `system/tools/mkbootimg` repo to the chromiumos manifest.\n\n@jwerner@chromium.org I wonder if we could keep this file here under Apache license.

Rewrite the struct definition by ourselves, so that we can have whatever license we want. This option is easier, but with higher risks.\n2. Ask the upstream to re-license it to something like `Apache OR BSD`. I haven\u0027t checked if BSD is allowed in AOSP.

We cannot redistribute an Apache file as BSD.\n\nWe shouldn\u0027t be the first ones that have this problem, there are other GPL bootloaders out there that Android vendors have already been using for years. For example, U-Boot has most of this here: https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot/blob/master/include/android_image.h (Oddly, Android themselves hosts an outdated BSD version of this file here: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bootable/bootloader/legacy/+/b1fde5cd7d5158b8e6876139ca76a341d0e49708/include/boot/bootimg.h.)\n\nAndroid should have a CLA so they should have the rights to relicense this however they want. I would suggest to start an email thread with opensource-licensing@ and whatever team owns this on the Android side and just ask if we can relicense this to BSD.",

I think it would be better to get an official solution for this problem and copy the canonical file from Android rather than that workaround though (since the U-Boot version also doesn\u0027t quite have all the contents), so I think we should try that first. Ideally, we can convince Android to just relicense or dual-license that file on their end (since Apache is really not the best license for a header you want everyone to be able to copy).",
