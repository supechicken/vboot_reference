      "message": "I wonder if we still need the kernel_version_tpm_start (or newer equivalent). I think the original reason of having that was to avoid repeatedly calling RollbackKernelRead() when it still did a TPM access every time. But now that we have the TPM contents cached in the context, I think we could just directly use vb2_secdata_kernel_get() here to retrieve the \"original\" version, and only need one variable in SD to keep track of the potentially updated one.",
