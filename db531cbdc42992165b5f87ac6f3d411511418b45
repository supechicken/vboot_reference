      "message": "Instead of spreading the ifdef throughout the code, I wonder if we can have a stub host/lib/host_p11_stub.c (and add it in the Makefile), which implements all the functions in host_p11.h for the `!HAVE_NSS` case. The `pkcs11_key` struct can also be defined as an empty structure for `!HAVE_NSS`. Then, host_p11.h can always be included, and the rest of the code remains the same as it is right now.",
