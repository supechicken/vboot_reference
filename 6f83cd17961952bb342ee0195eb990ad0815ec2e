I think it would be better to avoid that. If you want to print something here you can just print the number, or just don\u0027t print anything at all (for such a simple info returning function it might be better if it just doesn\u0027t have side effects -- we print all of this stuff in other places during boot already anyway).",

A lot of the identifiers in the code haven\u0027t been updated yet, but maybe it would be good for at least this somewhat user-visible string to use the new term.\n\n(Also, does it really make sense for almost all of these to say \"boot\" at the end? I think if it ends up printing just \"boot_mode\u003ddeveloper\" that would probably be enough?)",
