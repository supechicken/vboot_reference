      "message": "I\u0027ve been playing around with doing an Arm port of this code for a bit, and I noticed in the version I tested there that I would get a very noticeable speed difference (about 30%!) if I declare this as `const struct vb2_public_key *restrict key` instead. I believe the problem is that the compiler thinks it needs to reload `key-\u003earrsize` at every iteration of the inner loop because it cannot tell that the pointer for `key` doesn\u0027t point to the same memory as `de`, and thus updating `de` might have changed `key-\u003earrsize`.\n\nI don\u0027t have an Intel device to test this for your version at hand right now, but you might want to try it out and see if it makes a difference for you as well. (Alternatively you should get the same benefits by just putting `key-\u003earrsize` into a local variable at the top of the function and using that everywhere else.)",
