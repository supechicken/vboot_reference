      "message": "Do you think these portions should be included from Makefiles in each subdir?\n\nIt feels a big ugly to have to change things here, and this file is getting big!\n\nAlso it might be possible to have something like:\n\nSUBDIR :\u003d cgpt\n\nCSRCS :\u003d cgpt.c cgpt_create.c ...\n\nSRCS :\u003d $(addprefix $(SUBDIR),$(CSRCS) \n\nActually I also wonder if you should define the .o files rather than the .c, since you immediately change one into the other?",
