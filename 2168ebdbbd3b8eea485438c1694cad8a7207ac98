      "message": "\u0027make runtests\u0027 (run within chroot) seemed to run to successful completion.  I had tried the \"USE\u003d-minimal\" approach mentioned in the bug, but for me it didn\u0027t seem to cause the additional tests to be run (I was using emerge-atlas instead of emerge-falco, though I doubt it matters).  Using \u0027emerge\u0027 w/o a board did cause MINIMAL to be blank and cause the additional tests to be run without needing to explicitly request it.",
