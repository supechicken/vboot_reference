Is that mandated by the spec somehow (I assume since this is a virtual space we made up there\u0027s no specification about how this should work anyway)? Why don\u0027t we just make the GSC accept platform auth there?",

Maybe I\u0027m misunderstanding details there but I don\u0027t see why we\u0027d ever want to have a space like that in the first place. Isn\u0027t user auth always available and thus always the \"lowest\" authorization type?\n\nI think unless there\u0027s a good reason for things to work this way, we should change this on the GSC, and we should be able to avoid adding this function because there should never be a case that needs it.",
