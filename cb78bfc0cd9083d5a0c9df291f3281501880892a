If you\u0027re still keen to understand what this CL is aiming for, please take a look at https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/topic:%22unified_ap_debug%22\n\nHere is high level summary and I will share the design doc later\n\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nGoogle non-firmware team, SoC Partners and/or OxMs encounter three main problems when debugging silicon firmware:\n - Need for custom images: Partners must create special debug builds to enable verbose logging, requiring source code access and build expertise.\n - Replication challenges: Debugging and replicating issues becomes difficult as the custom debug build may not accurately represent the original failing firmware version.\n - Limited accessibility: Hardware and integration teams without firmware development expertise are hindered from debugging silicon-related issues.\n\n# Proposed Solution\nTo address these problems, we propose a new approach to AP firmware image creation and debug logging:\n- Dual Image Approach: Continue providing two AP firmware images:\n   * image-$BOARD.bin: Production image with release builds of both coreboot and silicon firmware (optimized for performance).\n   * image-$BOARD.serial.bin: Enhanced image containing:\n      - Debug build of coreboot.\n      - Debug build of silicon firmware.\n\n- Dynamic Debug Control: Introduce a mechanism to dynamically control the verbosity of silicon firmware debug logs. This will be achieved through a flag in the Google Binary Block (GBB).\n\n- coreboot Integration: Leverage coreboot\u0027s capability to handle and route silicon firmware debug messages. coreboot will:\n    * Read the GBB flag during initialization.\n    * Based on the flag\u0027s value, either enable or suppress the output of debug messages from the silicon firmware.",
