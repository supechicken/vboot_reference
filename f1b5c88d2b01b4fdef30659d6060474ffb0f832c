JSON is for machines, not humans.  i don\u0027t know what tools vboot_reference would accept though in the test suite ... if `jq` is acceptable, that would be easy to filter both to normalize \u0026 then compare.\n\nthe other files already pass.  for .txt files, we enforce no trailing space, and our tools shouldn\u0027t be omitting those.",
