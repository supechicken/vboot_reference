I guess that should be fine?\n\nOtherwise, we\u0027ll need a way for Makefile to tell whether it\u0027s for unit tests or not, and define `test_mockable` only in test environment. Two approaches that I can think of:\n\n1. Check the make target name (similar how unit tests are handled in depthcharge). This may require some refactoring work for Makefile.\n2. Pass `UNIT_TEST\u003d1` to make, from the ebuild. This would make running tests locally (by `make runtests`) more inconvenient.",

      "message": "The problem with using different compilation flags is that object files cannot be  shared between test builds and normal host library builds. For coreboot/depthcharge there\u0027s no host library and test object files are completely separate from firmware object files, so that\u0027s no issue. For vboot, the current system still assumes it can just link them together (e.g. TEST_BINS: LIBS \u003d ${UTILLIB}), so you can\u0027t just set -DUNIT_TESTS\u003d1 for tests but not for host utilities.\n\nI think the best option would be to refactor the Makefile to completely separate test builds from host utility builds. so that this becomes possible. (Maybe it would be nice to import some other tricks from the coreboot/depthcharge test frameworks while doing that... it\u0027s pretty annoying to have to put a test_mockable in front of almost every function declaration in vboot, it\u0027s nicer to have a system like coreboot/depthcharge where tests can declare what functions they mock and the #pragma weak directives get generated automatically based on that. A lower effort but probably also effective option would be to just build all test object files with `-Og` instead of `-Os`.)",

      "message": "How about partially re-writing vboot build system to make it similar to coreboot/depthcharge? coreboots\u0027 build system is nice when it comes to building both target and host binaries at the same time, so I think it might work here as well. Of course, it would slightly increase build time, but it would introduce builds isolation.\nWith that, it would be easier to port coreboot/depthcharge test framework here and create non-invasive tests (no test_mockable etc.)\n\nRewrite like will be time-consuming, but I think it\u0027s worth the effort if this project has to be maintained for years from now on. I think, that current Makefile is too complicated, yet too primitive, and thus causes many problems.",
