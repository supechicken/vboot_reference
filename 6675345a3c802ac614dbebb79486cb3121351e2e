I also just stumbled across this recently.\n\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure just plumbing the file name through everything as yet another parameter is the best solution. I think in general it\u0027s pretty confusing that for most of these functions the `name` parameter is a file name, but for a few of them it only is in some circumstances but not in others. I\u0027d prefer to do a wider cleanup there to better prevent these kinds of issues in the future.\n\nI\u0027ve uploaded CL:4691093 as an alternative solution to this, please have a look.",
