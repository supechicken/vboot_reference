      "message": "But does this actually still work for you—I mean, can crdyboot boot an image built with this? Because like you said, bootloader_size will still be 4K aligned, and there is no way to tell that the actual bootstub image was smaller. So your original reven kernel looks like\n\n\u003c3.5K EFI stub\u003e\u003c32-bit kernel\u003e\n\nand then futility will turn that into this kernel partition body\n\n\u003c32-bit kernel\u003e\u003c4K command line\u003e\u003c3.5K EFI stub\u003e\u003c0.5K padding\u003e\n\nand then when crdyboot tries to copy things back into place it ends up with\n\n\u003c3.5K EFI stub\u003e\u003c0.5K padding\u003e\u003c32-bit kernel\u003e\n\nSo I assume that wouldn\u0027t work anymore? How does the EFI stub know that the 32-bit kernel starts 512 bytes later than it thought?",
