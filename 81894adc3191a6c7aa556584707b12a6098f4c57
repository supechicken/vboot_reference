      "message": "Not against this change, but I think we should also provide a facility to override the flashrom command via environment variable like we have for cbfstool (see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/vboot_reference/+/refs/heads/main/host/lib/cbfstool.c#14) so the caller can have more control when needed. (Could be in this patch or in a follow-up, but I think it would be good to add that.)",
