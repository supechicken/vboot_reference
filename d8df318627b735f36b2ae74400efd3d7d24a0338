      "message": "The expectation is that it is the same as what\u0027s in the main firmware, and we do need the select parameter anyway since U-Boot doesn\u0027t know which that is. The only difference is that instead of U-Boot trying to remember or guess which version is currently running, vboot just tells it.\n\nIf there is no image, what would have happened before this change? Adding the select argument should have no effect on that.",

      "message": "So, what happens if the EC requests a firmware which is not the current one?\n\nWhat I mean is that if there\u0027s a parameter which MUST be a certain value, we should comment that.  e.g.\n\n\"The \u003cselect\u003e parameter must be the same firmware image chosen by VbSelectFirmware().  If it is a different image, or this function is called before VbSelectFirmware(), the results of this call are undefined.\"\n\n(on the other hand, if this call will work correctly if passed either A or B, regardless of which one is current, then we don\u0027t need the above comment, and we also don\u0027t need to indicate that it\u0027s the main firmware in use...)",
