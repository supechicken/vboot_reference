      "message": "There should be a bunch in vb21_struct.h that you can remove if you take out these two functions, too (all the keyblock and preamble stuff). (I am wondering a bit if after all those years we should finally delete this just now, when we\u0027re planning to switch signature algorithms in a year or two. There were *some* good ideas in those structs, after all, and a bunch of code and tests already written. I guess we can always bring it back if we feel like it later, or at least cherry-pick ideas from it?)",
