      "message": "Technically this isn\u0027t right because the shellball_dir--if it has IFS characters in it--will expand correctly here and then later when ${loemdir_arg} is expanded, the IFS characters will cause word splitting. Like this:\n\n  $ foo\u003d\"bar baz.txt\"\n  $ cmd\u003d\"--arg ${foo}\"\n  $ for x in ${cmd}; do echo $x; done\n  --arg\n  bar\n  baz.txt\n\nHowever, it doesn\u0027t really matter that much for this case because shellball_dir shouldn\u0027t have IFS characters in it.\n\nIf you want to fix this, you\u0027ll want to use a shell array for the two arguments: --loemdir and the path are entries in the array. Then, below, the array would be splatted with \"${array[@]}\".\n\nYes, shell is terrible.",
