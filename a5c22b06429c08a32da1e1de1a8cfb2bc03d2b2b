      "message": "I don\u0027t think the human-readable output should change. It works well for what it\u0027s trying to do. Having exactly one machine-parseable line for each human-readable line with FT_PRINT() is a convenience because 90% of the time that\u0027s what you want anyway, but it is not a hard rule. In cases where it makes sense for human-readable output to be arranged a bit differently than machine-parseable output we should do that.",
