Maybe the best solution would be to add separate functions to access this rather than trying to merge it in here, similar to vb2_secdata_fwmp_get_dev_key_hash().",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea to have H1 hack around in these spaces to communicate this. For now, I\u0027d suggest we create a separate API to retrieve the NO_BOOT flag, and then pass it through the vb2_context.\n\nWe\u0027ve already been talking about consolidating H1 commands at some point, so we\u0027d have a single vendor command that returns all 3 NVRAM spaces we care about and could also return separate information like this. But the information is still logically separate from the NVRAM space in that case, it\u0027s just bundled in the same command. And there\u0027s no need to tie these feature changes to that.",
