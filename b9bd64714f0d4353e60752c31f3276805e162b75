      "message": "signer test failures related to this are in crrev.com/i/4897193 - AFAICT we\u0027re in a situation where we cannot roll ToT vboot_reference updates into signer without at least breaking the tests (or possibly much worse) right now, I believe due to a part of crrev.com/c/3665477.\n\nFWIW, I\u0027m definitely not *completely* familiar between the relationship between vboot_reference, chromeos-firmware-update, signer, and the tests / test artifacts used by signer tests.\n\nOverall this seems to be an unfortunate situation, maybe we should be taking a different course of action here like updating the test bundles used by signer to use firmware update scripts that handle `--unpack`, and/or maybe we should make this script first try `--unpack` then fall back to `--sb_extract` so at least image signing won\u0027t prevent us from removing `--sb_extract` option from the relevant scripts. But again, I suspect others would have a much more informed opinion on this than I :)",
