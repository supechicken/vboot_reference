      "message": "I think we should either transform the entire file to vboot coding style (including things like indentation style), or leave it exactly as it was. Or do you think there\u0027s a technical problem with `#pragma once` with our toolchain?\n\nI\u0027d normally say everything needs to be converted to our coding style, but I can also see an argument to be made that leaving it makes it easier to pull in future updates... so I think I\u0027m fine with either option.",
