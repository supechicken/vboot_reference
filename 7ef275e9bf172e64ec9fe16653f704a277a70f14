      "message": "Ok, then I\u0027d call it CSME because it\u0027s easier to search and figure out than a simple \u0027me\u0027, also indicating it may have security related features (e.g., include CSE lite).\n\nP.S: What\u0027s the difference between ME/CSE/CSME and CSE lite? I thought CSE lite were providing TPM related functions, so the system was \"ME\" + \"CSE lite\" \u003d \"CSME\". But if you say ME\u003dCSE\u003dCSME, then what\u0027s CSE lite?",
