      "message": "This is failing in the case of a factory shim with both KERN-A and KERN-B (built using Chih-Yao\u0027s changes). KERN-A works, but KERN-B fails to boot with a dm-verity failure.\n\nIt\u0027s because update_rootfs_hash() only calculates the hash for ROOT-A. I guess we need to change it so that for factory shims it calculates hashes for both ROOT-A and ROOT-B, and fills them into the corresponding kernels?\n\nThere are also several other places in the script which assume we only have ROOT-A - resign_firmware_payload(), remove_old_container_key(), resign_android_image_if_exists(), sign_uefi_binaries(). So I guess we have to update them too.",

      "message": "Ugh... I know we\u0027ve been discussing this back and forth for a bit too long now, but this seems like another good reason to not use a full ROOT-B on the factory shim for me. I feel like we have to add special cases all over the place just to support that shim doing something that\u0027s inefficient to begin with.\n\nCan\u0027t we just give in and disable kernel-level verity for factory shims so we don\u0027t need to deal with all this crap? Just removing the `root\u003d/dev/dm-0` should be good enough, right? Then the kernel won\u0027t do anything, and we can just fall back to doing userland setup_dm_root everywhere, and we don\u0027t need to worry about all these complicated differences between recovery sticks and factory shims on this kernel version vs that kernel version, etc.\n\nThat\u0027s just one little patch to change the build process somewhere, I feel like that would be less complex than trying to respect all these extra special cases in the signing script? If we just have base_image_util.sh or cros_make_image_bootable pass --boot_args\u003d\u0027root\u003d\u0027 through to build_kernel_image.sh when building a factory image, wouldn\u0027t that be enough to do the trick? The boot_args passed as a flag get added after the default root\u003d/dev/dm-0 argument, and when it appears multiple times in the command line the latter should override the earlier. (And then we can go with the 1 sector KERN-B solution where wait_for_gpt_root automatically decides to pick the other partition if the one associated with the current kernel is that small.)",

If we\u0027re modifying the command line in the build script anyway, it seems like we might as well change it to the correct value instead of making it fail.\n\nWe could add a root_offset argument to build_kernel_image.sh, and have it use that in get_base_root(). It seems reasonable to make this an argument anyway. We already pass a lot of other verity parameters as arguments.\n\nFor the initramfs case, wait_for_gpt_root() could get the offset from the command line, so we wouldn\u0027t need the check if size is \u003e 1 sector logic, and there\u0027s still only a single place where we\u0027re encoding which rootfs to use (the build script which overrides the offset).",

If we\u0027re modifying the command line in the build script anyway, it seems like we might as well change it to the correct value instead of making it fail.\n\nWell... I agree both are possible options. I think my suggestion would have the advantage that it gets rid of kernel-based verity initialization completely (I think if we can just make verity on recovery shims and all factory shims regardless of kernel version work the same way, that would just make all of this a bit easier to maintain by reducing the number of different cases we need to keep in mind), and that it can be implemented with a little less impact on the existing build scripts (basically just one line, rather than piping a whole separate option through to build_kernel_image.sh). But on the other hand, I agree that my suggestion may be seen as a bit of a hack.\n\nI don\u0027t really have a strong opinion towards one or the other, though. Both are much better than trying to put in a whole second rootfs and all the extra changes we\u0027d need for that.",
