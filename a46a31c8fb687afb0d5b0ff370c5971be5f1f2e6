      "message": "This is failing in the case of a factory shim with both KERN-A and KERN-B (built using Chih-Yao\u0027s changes). KERN-A works, but KERN-B fails to boot with a dm-verity failure.\n\nIt\u0027s because update_rootfs_hash() only calculates the hash for ROOT-A. I guess we need to change it so that for factory shims it calculates hashes for both ROOT-A and ROOT-B, and fills them into the corresponding kernels?\n\nThere are also several other places in the script which assume we only have ROOT-A - resign_firmware_payload(), remove_old_container_key(), resign_android_image_if_exists(), sign_uefi_binaries(). So I guess we have to update them too.",
