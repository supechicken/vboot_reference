      "message": "I don\u0027t mind adding documentation for these, but I feel like what you wrote doesn\u0027t actually add that much? I think you\u0027re basically just repeating the word that\u0027s already in the enum name (i.e. \"Returns output for a command in \u003cnormal/neater/flashrom/human/flash_ec\u003e format\"). I think it would make more sense to actually describe how the format looks (e.g. HUMAN is hierarchical output that uses indentation to show nesting, flash_ec shows the first and the last (inclusive) offset of each section, etc.)?\n\nAlso note that PRETTY is just a very barebones output mode that prints all numbers in decimal, I wouldn\u0027t really call it \"neat\". It\u0027s actually referred to as \"parseable\" in the usage help text and that seems to be what it\u0027s actually designed for. Not sure why it is called PRETTY here.",
