      "message": "Does this test actually still work now? Because I believe the ZGB image uses the dev keyblock, so if you take that out I\u0027d expect the old binary to no longer match what the new futility would product. I think in this case it actually makes sense to remove this ZGB image completely now (unless there is anything else still using it? But I think the only reason this is here in addition to the Link and Peppy ones is to test dev keyblock).",
