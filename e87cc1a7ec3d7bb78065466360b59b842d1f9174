There is a few things I want to resolve here in a follow up as to not micro-optimise here and get this over the line.\n\nSpecifically, the plan is for model_apply_white_label() to consume cfg and do the get_firmware_image_temp_file() internally as it dispatches out to vpd. In this way all its call sites need no longer assume valid file_name and works towards reducing the reliance on that, preferring instead to pass buffers.",
