(Change the implementation) We will only use VB2_SCREEN_* defined in 2api.h for here and for vb2_menu indexing. Need to have a VB2_SCREEN_*-to-vb2_menu lookup function. (like the depthcharge\u0027s ui_get_descriptor)\n\nConsidering that eventually all the UI code will be moved to depthcharge (chromium:1035800), maybe we should do something similar to depthcharge here, which is option #2.",
