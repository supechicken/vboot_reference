      "message": "I\u0027m honestly wondering if there\u0027s a point in hashing this, as opposed to just putting the raw version number in the lowest 4 bytes and zeroing the rest. I know that\u0027s how it\u0027s intended to be used, but it\u0027s also intended to be used with much larger data buffers, and it shouldn\u0027t make a difference (since the process of extension itself hashes it again anyway). I think firing up the SHA algorithm again here would just be a waste of time (although it\u0027s probably pretty fast for one block).\n\n+Andrey, what do you think?",
