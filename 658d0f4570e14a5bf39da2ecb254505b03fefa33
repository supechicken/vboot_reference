      "message": "I\u0027m honestly wondering if there\u0027s a point in hashing this, as opposed to just putting the raw version number in the lowest 4 bytes and zeroing the rest. I know that\u0027s how it\u0027s intended to be used, but it\u0027s also intended to be used with much larger data buffers, and it shouldn\u0027t make a difference (since the process of extension itself hashes it again anyway). I think firing up the SHA algorithm again here would just be a waste of time (although it\u0027s probably pretty fast for one block).\n\n+Andrey, what do you think?",

      "message": "1) yeah, I\u0027d just extend the \u002700..00\u003cver\u003e\u0027 value instead of hashing it. all those level of indirection only complicate things w/o adding to security.\n2) I know it\u0027s a bit late, but to avoid growing the compatibility gap between CrOS use of PCRs and other systems use of PCRs, how about we use NV spaces with TPMA_NV_EXTEND/TPM_NT_EXTEND + TPMA_NV_CLEAR_STCLEAR attributes (+ I suggest TPMA_NV_ORDERLY to avoid committing it to flash), which behave like PCRs. But instead of spending one of 16 PCR indices we spend just one of 2^24 nv indices, and avoid potential compatibility issues.\nthat would require creating those spaces with platform auth if they are not created yet, but we have code for that already.",

      "message": "and then :) if we switch to nv spaces, why do we even care about PCR-like-extending model and TPMA_NV_EXTEND/TPM_NT_EXTEND. just use TPMA_NV_WRITE_STCLEAR + TPMA_NV_CLEAR_STCLEAR and do Write+WriteLock (we also have code for that). actually, even TPMA_NV_CLEAR_STCLEAR is optional. just overwrite on every boot and then Lock. instead of digests, use version as-is. GSC code then can just take the version from this field and insert into the cert as-is (w/o the need to capture the extended value at PCR_Write or without the need for cert consumer to track digest-to-version mapping if the want to enforce version\u003e\u003dX policy).",
