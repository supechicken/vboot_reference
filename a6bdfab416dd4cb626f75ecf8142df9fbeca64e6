      "message": "No, the idea is that tlcl itself does the mapping when necessary. See example in TlclRead in tpm2_lite/tlcl.c: 0x28b (RC_FMT1 | TPM_RC_HANDLE | TPM_RC_2) from TPM2_NV_Read -\u003e TPM_E_BADINDEX, since places like RollbackFwmpRead() in vboot_reference/firmware/lib/rollback_index.c treat that code in a special way. technically, there\u0027s no single value that says \"BADINDEX\" in TPM2 (depending on which handle it is in a command we\u0027ll have a different RC_HANDLE variation - I haven\u0027t checked if we are ever not handle 2 in other commands), so do this mapping to a single special code in the places where it matters makes sense to me.\n\nIt\u0027s fortunate that TPM2 result codes are designed to avoid collisions with TPM1.2 codes, so we will not get 0x00..02 (BADINDEX) from a spec-compliant TPM2 chip. For TPM2, this result code can be generated only by the tlcl itself, similar to \"vboot local\" codes aabove in this header.\n\nThere is a separate question of \n - converting literal 0x28b to something more meaningful.\n - documenting which special codes are expected from which functions. I went through the firmware code and see that we have this special treatment for TPM_E_BADINDEX, TPM_E_INVALID_POSTINIT, TPM_E_MAXNVWRITES, TPM_E_NEEDS_SELFTEST, TPM_E_DOING_SELFTEST.\n\nBut that\u0027s a topic for a separate cleanup.",

      "message": "So that means whoever writes code that relies on one of the error codes below for a certain function where the code wasn\u0027t \"relevant\" before, that code would become a new \"relevant\" error code and the engineer would have to take care of adding the mapping code?\n\nMy main worry here is that it becomes pretty unclear what codes are legit to check for in consuming code, and which can cause issues (such as TPM 2.0 not translating them). In an ideal world, we\u0027d document for each function which  error situations generate a well defined error code (across both TPM 1.2 and 2.0). And these well-behaved error codes would ideally be different from the TPM-generated ones. And we\u0027d further not export declarations of half-supported codes in the headers (i.e. we\u0027d only export vboot local codes and both TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 would map to the supported ones).\n\nMy original question was whether you\u0027re intending to make an effort to get into a predictable state or if the situation is going to be best effort (i.e. developers working on consuming code are expected to go in and fix up error handling for error situations they care about).\n\nNote that at this point I\u0027m just trying to understand the intention, I haven\u0027t made up my mind what I consider acceptable or not.",
