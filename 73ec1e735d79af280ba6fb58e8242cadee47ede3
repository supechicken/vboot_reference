      "message": "I would really suggest naming this \"ctx\" and the other \"nvram_backend_fake_ctx\" or something like that, to make it very clear that that other thing is *not* a real vboot context. It\u0027s a byte array whose only purpose it is to back the VbExNvStorageRead() stub. The only reason it\u0027s using struct vb2_context is so that we can (ab-)use vb2_nv_set() to easily manipulate it.\n\nAlso, the ctx that\u0027s passed into VbSelectAndLoadKernel() should probably be a local, there\u0027s no reason for it to be global.",
