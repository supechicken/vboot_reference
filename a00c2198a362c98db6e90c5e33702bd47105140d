(Also, didn\u0027t we pick such an incredibly clever CRC algorithm that an all-zero buffer actually counts as valid? I vaguely recall something like that...)\n\nI\u0027d just set the struct_version to 1, recalcuate the CRC and check that you get the right error for invalid struct version. (Do we even check that? We probably should...) There\u0027s already a check for bad CRCs below.",
