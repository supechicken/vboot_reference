Unfortunately, I don\u0027t have any good way to know if we\u0027re on a newer Chromebook where it is invalid or if we\u0027re on some legacy Chromebook where it\u0027s valid. I also have no historical knowledge to know if some old legacy Chromebook absolutely relies on `WPSW_BOOT`. Thus, printing a warning is my best answer for now...",
