Looks like you added it for equivalence with VBSD_BOOT_FIRMWARE_SW_WP_ENABLED, but that was never really used by calling firmware and officially deprecated with CL:575389. No need to drag it on into the vboot2 world.",

      "message": "nit: I feel the union here is kinda weird and not really useful for anything, especially since you essentially end up having to replace every nvdata in the code with nvdata2 anyway. Why not just keep the name nvdata and increase the size?",
