      "message": "I\u0027d really like to do the same thing in vb21_api_tests.c, but unfortunately I can\u0027t since it is a full integration test (calls through to the actual vb2_digest_* functions instead of stubbing them out). I don\u0027t really see a good way to test which functions are called in that model (e.g. make sure vboot doesn\u0027t switch back-and-forth between hardware and software crypto functions in between)... it would be much simpler to test the vb2api* functions from both ends (like this file) and relegate testing of the vb2_digest* functions solely to vb2_sha_tests.c. What do you think?",
