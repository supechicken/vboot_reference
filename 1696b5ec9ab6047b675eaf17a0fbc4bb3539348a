Seems that if it needs nothing from this file it can compile just fine, but if it tries to pull in some functions (like my new stubs) it has to pull them all and will complain about the duplicate symbols.",

      "message": "I\u0027d really like to do the same thing in vb21_api_tests.c, but unfortunately I can\u0027t since it is a full integration test (calls through to the actual vb2_digest_* functions instead of stubbing them out). I don\u0027t really see a good way to test which functions are called in that model (e.g. make sure vboot doesn\u0027t switch back-and-forth between hardware and software crypto functions in between)... it would be much simpler to test the vb2api* functions from both ends (like this file) and relegate testing of the vb2_digest* functions solely to vb2_sha_tests.c. What do you think?",
