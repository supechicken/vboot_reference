If not, we need to be sure it doesn\u0027t introduce one.\n\nSince this will make a change to the behavior for all future systems, not just Pixel (which I gather from related CLs is the root of the problem). It needs more discussion, testing, and justification besides just mentioning what the effect of the CL is.\n\nPlease create a bug to explain why this needs doing.\n\nThanks.",
