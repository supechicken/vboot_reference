      "message": "I haven\u0027t paid attention to the temporary branch-only stuff, so I\u0027m reading up on this for the first time. go/adb-enablement explicitly says that you\u0027re not planning to port this flag to the main branch because it was supposed to be a temporary solution. How did that change?\n\nIf we want this on the main branch, I would like to understand better what it does and why it should be a GBB flag vs. other alternatives. GBB flags are generally just meant to control vboot boot flow behavior and we\u0027re trying to avoid making them a kitchen sink for everything. What is even reading this flag right now? If that\u0027s nothing in firmware code, it should probably not be a GBB flag.\n\nFrom the requirements in the doc (especially \"Images will have logic to clear the enablement flag if the device isn’t owned\"), it sounds like a GBB flag really isn\u0027t a good fit for this problem anyway, and you\u0027d probably just want some control file on a user-encrypted disk partition instead that will automatically get invalidated when the user account is removed.",
