      "message": "@jwerner@chromium.org I have some concerns about misc partition. I load it here without any validation (it is not described and verified by vbmeta, because its content is created by kernel). There is even no CRC to ensure integrity of the content. What do you think, should we adopt this solution as this is how Android is handling entering recovery (and assume that it is good enough) or should we propose different solution?",

      "message": "The general idea that boot control metadata is unverified is normal and true for the ChromeOS approach as well. However, I\u0027m not sure having a whole extra disk partition with its own format just for this stuff is a good idea. I thought(?) that the bootloader_message stuff was not a generic Android requirement but only a Pixel implementation detail, and other OEMs are free to implement the same features in other ways?\n\nIf possible, I think it would be better to integrate this into vboot nvdata instead. We would not be using big strings like \"boot-recovery\" there, but just a small bit field to encode the possible values. Whether that\u0027s feasible depends on how much of this bootloader_message block is really used by Android in practice... if it\u0027s only the one thing you\u0027re implementing here (normal, bootonce or recovery), then that should fit into vboot nvdata. The bootloader message file suggests that there are uses for the other fields, e.g. \"recovery\" is supposed to contain a kernel command line for recovery boot... we should check whether that\u0027s actually used that way and how exactly it works (e.g. can we just hardcode that recovery commandline in firmware instead and turn the field into a single on/off bit?). The idea that a whole kernel command line is read out of an unverified partition _does_ sound pretty dangerous to me.",

      "message": "The \"recovery\" field is not a kernel command line but it contains arguments for `recovery` application which is executed in Android recovery. (Some options are [there](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bootable/recovery/+/refs/heads/main/recovery_main.cpp#349) and rest are [there](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bootable/recovery/+/refs/heads/main/recovery.cpp#594) with some [comments](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bootable/recovery/+/refs/heads/main/recovery.cpp#75))\n\nSo if we would like to not use misc partition at all, we need to not only translate commands (bootonce, normal, recovery) but also somehow pass arguments to recovery executable.\n\nI am not sure how much AOSP relies on misc partition presence for other purposes than recovery, but documentation reserves some space on the partition for use by AOSP, [misc layout](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bootable/recovery/+/refs/heads/main/bootloader_message/include/bootloader_message/bootloader_message.h#25) 32K-64K.\n\nSo we have option a) where we integrate bootcommand and recover arguments into vboot nvdata or b) we will just use misc. Option a) seems to be more robust, but we will need to revisit this code every time when Android recovery gain new option. Also we may miss out on any new Android feature that requires misc partition. Option b) is easier to implement, because this and deptcharge CL is enough to use Android recovery for userdata wipe and other functionalities. For option a) we would need to modify recovery to read its arguments from nvdata.",
