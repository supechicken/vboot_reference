      "message": "I think the convention is that major version signifies totally incompatible changes, whereas minor version is incremental ones? So I think you generally check that the major version is equal and the minor version is greater or equal to the one we expect. At least that\u0027s how it\u0027s done for the GBB (see 2lib/2misc.c).",

Any small changes in logic can be accounted for by checking the minor version.\n\nIf the data structure passed is newer than that of the code, then the changes to the data structure should be forwards compatible (along the same major version).

That means we will encounter problems with \"signature\" and \"shared_data\".  \"V2\" might be a nice way of solving that earlier than later.
