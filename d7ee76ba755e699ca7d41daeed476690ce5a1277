Have you got agreement from the factory team, SIEs and TAMs (also ODMs)? Do the partners know how to get the right images? What about the test/lab/CTS thing? They used to rely on \u0027model\u0027 to make sure the test coverage.\n\nAlso, even if you are determined to do that, we should not change the updater. Instead you should change the mapping of crosid (+jrosenth) - no need to touch the futility side.",
