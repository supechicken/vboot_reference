      "message": "No parens around the return 0.\n\nYou should be checking this condition within the loop. There\u0027s no guarantee your  data is sane coming in here.  But what I don\u0027t understand is you have your terminating uid fields as the first ones in the array.  Please put those at the end of the arrays so you can check the terminating entry (uid \u003d\u003d 0) within the loop.",

      "message": "The function is static, so the \"data\" is coming from within this file from either of the {Braswell,Baytrail}FindGpioChipOffset functions. The *gpio_num and *offset values are not constrained (except they are unsigned so not negative).\n\nThe logic is to find the the largest entry which is less than or equal to the provided key, but to have an error if the key is too big.\n\nSo you could reverse the values in the table, add a final entry with a ((unsigned int) -1) entry and do something like this (cf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dBvmRI6K8TS8 ) and hope no one spots the boundary condition error. \n\n\nunsigned int best_uid\u003ddata-\u003euid;\nif (*gpio_num \u003e\u003d max_good_value) return 0;\n\ndo { \n   if (*gpio_num \u003c data-\u003ebase)\n         break;\n   best_uid \u003d data-\u003euid;\n   data++;\n}\n\nwhile(0 !\u003d (ent \u003d ....\n    ....\n    if (best_uid \u003d\u003d uid_value) {\n       match++;\n       break;\n    } \n\nYou could make the data table have the upper limit of the range which simplifies the logic (and avoids the problem of answering the previous question) but makes the values less obvious.",
