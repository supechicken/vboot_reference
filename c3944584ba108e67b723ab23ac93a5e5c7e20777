      "message": "FWIW TPM errors currently run from 0 to 0x5010.\n\nI think this may have been a concern in the past from problems like vb2_error_t functions incorrectly returning a TPM error code, but I believe we have fixed all of these now (fingers crossed).\n\nSo I don\u0027t think it should be an issue anymore, and we can probably even remove that comment...\n\n\nOn the other hand, we\u0027re haven\u0027t needed to use the \u003cVB2_REQUEST comparison yet, and we could just gate that on removing the last few vboot1-style errors (only three left now).  In that case, we could leave it at 0x1000000.  Julius, what\u0027s your preference?",

      "message": "When is that gonna happen? Because if we want to establish the rule that VB2_TRY() acts differently on VB2_REQUEST than VB2_ERROR, I would like to do that right now, not in some far out future when people have gotten used to it differently. So unless you were planning a big error cleanup this week anyway, let\u0027s please prioritize hooking this up to VB2_TRY() and using it to simplify the EC sync code (and wherever else it may be suitable).\n\nWith the TPM error concern... I guess if we wanna be really careful we should put it somewhere far out of the way that\u0027s unlikely to overlap with anything else after all (e.g. 0x95700000-0x95800000). The extra comparison operation is hopefully not gonna kill us",
