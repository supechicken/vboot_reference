A non-technical user will take the \"your system is damaged\" screen at face value and think they need to reinstall the software on their system.\n\nShould I put in more safeguards so that both TlclLockPhysicalPresence() and vb2ex_tpm_set_mode(VB2_TPM_MODE_DISABLED) properly handle being called twice (in case some code comes gets introduced that also disables the TPM)?  I think TlclLockPhysicalPresence() already has some handling (it sets a few global bools and is largely why I call it here), but offhand I\u0027m inclined to think that any 2nd or subsequent call to vb2ex_tpm_set_mode(VB2_TPM_MODE_DISABLED) will fail because it can\u0027t communicate with the tpm.",
