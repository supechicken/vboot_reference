Shouldn\u0027t we stick to that for consistency?\n\n(In general, please be careful when allocating new combinations because it\u0027s not always as easy as it may seem. T seems to be an okay button to use as far as I can tell, but the M you had in the first patch set would have been problematic because on the French AZERTY layouts, that button is used for the comma instead.)",
