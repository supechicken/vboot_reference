      "message": "nit: I believe Randall called this \"official OS\" because calling it \"signed\" is a bit inaccurate: all kernels are signed, the difference is just whether the keyblock (that signs the kernel) was itself signed by the official key or some other random key.\n\nIf you end up calling it keyblock_valid below anyway, why don\u0027t you just call this need_valid_keyblock() or something?",

      "message": "So, fun fact: before this patch, if dev_boot_signed_only was set, we\u0027d check the signature but ignore things like rollback flags, because this just checks BOOT_MODE_DEVELOPER directly rather than need_keyblock_valid. Probably not a terrible vulnerability we need to backport given it\u0027s not a widely used feature, but still good to fix.",
