      "message": "I agree that it\u0027s a nice property to see that it is checked and cleared right away.  But I don\u0027t think that logic belongs in the main boot path branching point.\n\nIf you prefer not to group everything in the UI function (which admittedly isn\u0027t ideal), then perhaps we should try something like what Campfire did -- add an extra function call right after EC sync, with logic something like:\n\n  if DIAG_REQUEST:\n    unset DIAG_REQUEST\n    set VB2_CONTEXT_DIAGNOSTIC_MODE",
