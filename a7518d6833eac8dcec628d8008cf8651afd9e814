      "message": "I\u0027m fine with refactoring this as a quirk, however none of it is nissa-specific, and we\u0027re planning to use it on other intel platforms too, specifically MTL in the near future.\n\nDisabling GPR0 is necessary to update the ME on all platforms since JSL/TGL, and the offset/value is the same across platforms. The FLMSTR values should apply to all IFD v2 platforms. Is there any other part you think is nissa-specific?",

      "message": "So\n- We need to support platforms starting from APL (Apollolake).\n- GPR0 can\u0027t be applied on devices prior to JSL/TG.\n- The values for eve (KBL) was not the same.\n\nI think there are a several approaches.\n\n1. Let --unlock_me only do FLMSTR (so it should work on all platforms), and add \u0027disable_gpr0\u0027 as another quirk. People running the the commands must know what quirks they have to use.\n2. Figure out a term that can describe the difference of \"before jsl and after jsl\".\n3. If there is a way we can identify (from the firmware image, or runtime) if disabling GPR0 is needed then we can do that, and combine all the options back to \u0027--quirks unlock_me\u0027.\n\n@rekanorman@chromium.org do you know if it (3) is feasible?",

      "message": "The relevance of JSL/TGL is that\u0027s when we switched to CSE lite (CSE RO/RW split with updatable RW), and we use GPR0 to to protect the CSE RO.\n\nI just had a look at SPI programming guides for some older platforms and it seems the GPR0 field did exist, we just kept it disabled since we had no use for it (I think, need to check).\n\nAlso I was wrong about the offset being fixed, it actually varies and is even different on MTL. So you\u0027re right that this is nissa-specific for now and needs more work to make it generic. I already have a bug tracking that: b/270275115. Feel free to either change it back to _nissa, or add a TODO for me to make it generic.",
