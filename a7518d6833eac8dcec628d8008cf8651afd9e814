      "message": "I\u0027m fine with refactoring this as a quirk, however none of it is nissa-specific, and we\u0027re planning to use it on other intel platforms too, specifically MTL in the near future.\n\nDisabling GPR0 is necessary to update the ME on all platforms since JSL/TGL, and the offset/value is the same across platforms. The FLMSTR values should apply to all IFD v2 platforms. Is there any other part you think is nissa-specific?",
