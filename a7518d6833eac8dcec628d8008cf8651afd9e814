      "message": "I\u0027m fine with refactoring this as a quirk, however none of it is nissa-specific, and we\u0027re planning to use it on other intel platforms too, specifically MTL in the near future.\n\nDisabling GPR0 is necessary to update the ME on all platforms since JSL/TGL, and the offset/value is the same across platforms. The FLMSTR values should apply to all IFD v2 platforms. Is there any other part you think is nissa-specific?",

      "message": "So\n- We need to support platforms starting from APL (Apollolake).\n- GPR0 can\u0027t be applied on devices prior to JSL/TG.\n- The values for eve (KBL) was not the same.\n\nI think there are a several approaches.\n\n1. Let --unlock_me only do FLMSTR (so it should work on all platforms), and add \u0027disable_gpr0\u0027 as another quirk. People running the the commands must know what quirks they have to use.\n2. Figure out a term that can describe the difference of \"before jsl and after jsl\".\n3. If there is a way we can identify (from the firmware image, or runtime) if disabling GPR0 is needed then we can do that, and combine all the options back to \u0027--quirks unlock_me\u0027.\n\n@rekanorman@chromium.org do you know if it (3) is feasible?",
