Apache has a patent clause that makes it incompatible with many other licenses. You could mix BSD code into an Apache project but that would make the whole thing Apache, and then it couldn\u0027t be linked into GPL code (like coreboot) anymore.

They have ECDSA code here, maybe that\u0027s something that could be a usable substitute? (At least a starting point to steal code from, we shouldn\u0027t link the whole library and too much of its custom framework stuff.)\n\nhttps://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/blob/archive/mbedtls-2.7/library/ecdsa.c\n\n(If you do use this make sure you take it from a branch that still has the Apache/GPL dual license, like mbedtls-2.7. The most recent versions have dropped the GPL.)",
