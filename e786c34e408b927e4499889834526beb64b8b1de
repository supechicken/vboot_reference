      "message": "Sorry but I don\u0027t think this approach makes any sense compared to the other proposals for the CLI discussion. We can\u0027t just start supporting a totally separate bootloader just for a CLI payload, and do twice the driver bring-up work for every new platform.\n\nBesides, if we wanted to implement the CLI in a separate binary (and the other proposals don\u0027t go in that direction), we\u0027d probably want to load it from depthcharge with the existing chain-loading mechanisms and triggered by UI, not from coreboot with a GBB flag.",
