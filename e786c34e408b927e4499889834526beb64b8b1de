      "message": "Sorry but I don\u0027t think this approach makes any sense compared to the other proposals for the CLI discussion. We can\u0027t just start supporting a totally separate bootloader just for a CLI payload, and do twice the driver bring-up work for every new platform.\n\nBesides, if we wanted to implement the CLI in a separate binary (and the other proposals don\u0027t go in that direction), we\u0027d probably want to load it from depthcharge with the existing chain-loading mechanisms and triggered by UI, not from coreboot with a GBB flag.",

      "message": "That\u0027s fine, but it is very useful for me, at least. I am testing booting OSes which DC doesn\u0027t support.\n\nI believe there was one other CLI proposal using Depthcharge, but it\u0027s a pretty limited experience to say the least. In any case from what I can tell, you are not keen on that either?\n\nNot to state the obvious, but running it from Depthcharge means that DC needs to be working enough to do that, which precludes any early work where just coreboot might be enough. It also adds a manual step and a time delay which are undesirable, to say the least.\n\nSo I suggest we should go ahead with this and see how it goes.",

      "message": "Sorry but I don\u0027t think we should allocate GBB flags and put custom hacks into coreboot\u0027s payload selection code just for personal testing. If you want to boot U-Boot in your workflow, it\u0027s easy to write scripts that replace the payload in an image.\n\nI don\u0027t think having a U-Boot CLI to debug why depthcharge isn\u0027t working is a very realistic proposition. On any new platform we\u0027re going to put effort into bringing up our main bootloader first, and would expect to get that to work before we get any other debug-CLI-only payload to work.",
