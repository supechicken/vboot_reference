      "message": "If this is only used for kernel verification, should we separate it out from 2common.c?  And if so, my plan was to put everything in vboot_kernel.c for now, and merge into 2kernel.c once the file has been all cleaned up.  Do you think we should just put it directly in 2kernel.c, if that\u0027s where it will end up eventually?",

      "message": "Okay, I guess I\u0027m okay with this if you\u0027re just doing it temporarily until you can merge the files later. Although I\u0027m not sure if throwing all the kernel verification stuff into one big file is a good idea either... this file is already kinda large to begin with. Maybe splitting this into low-level utility functions and high-level logic somehow would make things a bit easier to follow.",
