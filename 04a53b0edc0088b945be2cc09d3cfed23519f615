It perhaps maybe more clear if I write you up a short one pager design doc rather than wrangling the detail on patch review. That way we can reach consensus faster and move forwards with this.\n\nThe overlap here is that I want to also canonical other flashrom paths across vboot_ref and bifurcate EC/PD/AP paths better as we want to get rid of cros_ec driver within flashrom itself in favor of libec linking directly here.

The strdup() was really just a intermediate step before spending too much effort to entirely redesign things and over commit on the idea being purposed here.\n\nI think to resolve your concern about regions being inside of firmware_image (which seems like a logical encapsulation of meaning by coupling those concepts at the type level) is to ensure we don\u0027t share instances of \u0027image\u0027 between I/O transactions. A \u0027image\u0027 instance per I/O transaction seems more logically consistent as not only mixing regions could be a problem but also other data fields of image such as the programmer type.\n\nI agree with that region construction API you are suggesting here around the firmware_region struct to ensure that value is built in a consistent manner.",
