      "message": "Note that with this patch, when people want to update the vboot stable hash for the singer (for example CL:*6214191), the `verity` binary in the signer ([code](https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/chromeos/cros-signing/+/refs/heads/dev/signer/signingtools-bin/verity)) also needs to be updated as well. Therefore, to avoid potential problems, I think it\u0027s better to update `verity` now, either by you or CrosKeyManagers.\n\n@vapier@chromium.org Do you prefer updating `verity` now, or wait until actually needed? I\u0027d like to avoid the problem of\n\n1. Update vboot stable hash\n2. Merge to production branch\n3. Signing fails\n4. Revert the production branch",
