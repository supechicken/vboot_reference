It probably gets confused because `${HOST_ARCH}` is directly derived off `uname` and not properly mocked for that. I think you should just check for `${ARCH}` instead, `${ARCH}` and `${HOST_ARCH}` can\u0027t really effectively differ anyway (because we\u0027re only building the library once and it must be able to both run on the target and get linked into the tests).",
