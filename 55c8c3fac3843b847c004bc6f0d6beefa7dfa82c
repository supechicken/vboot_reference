      "message": "First of all, the existing code works perfectly fine.\n\nWhy?  Since TEST_STR_EQ uses strcmp to compare the test case strings, and since the lengths of all test case strings are shorter than sizeof(set_vendor_data), we can be guaranteed that any memory past the end of set_vendor_data will never be accessed.\n\nIf coverity is complaining, then it should be sufficient to just modify the strncpy line to include the (- 1) as you have done.  There is no need for a memset() call, since global variables are implicitly initialized to 0, and by including the (- 1), we will never be modifying the last byte in the string array to anything other than \u0027\\0\u0027.  Is this sufficient to make coverity happy?",
