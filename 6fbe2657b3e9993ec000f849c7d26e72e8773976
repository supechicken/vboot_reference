This way you could later change the policy (which should be solely vboot\u0027s domain) without needing to modify depthcharge, e.g. if we ever decide to make it only wipe on the first dev mode boot or something.",

      "message": "I assume this is supposed to be a more generic interface to TPM storage? I still saw some explicit references to the TPM elsewhere (e.g. vb2ex_tpm_clear_owner())... is that an oversight? Or do Chromebooks still have to provide a TPM, but not necessarily store their dev-mode flag in there?\n\nWill vboot still link TPM storage functions or do we have to provide those in coreboot and depthcharge? (Since our current model accesses vboot from two codebases that makes things a little ugly.)",

Why not move it up into \"fields which must be initialized by caller\"? (It\u0027s kinda caller-initialized after all, just that vboot doesn\u0027t care about the value and initialization to 0 is fine as well.)",
