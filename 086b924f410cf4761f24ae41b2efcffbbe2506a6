It\u0027s also a necessary on assembly files btw. You see this patern quite a few times in the Linux kernel.",

This means it would also allow C code that uses float types (which is something we\u0027d want to avoid and get warnings for in coreboot), but since we\u0027re running the CI on GCC anyway we would still avoid checking in any code that does that, even if clang couldn\u0027t detect it.\n\nSo how about we solve this by making coreboot set `-mgeneral-regs-only` in AArch64 only for GCC, and make it set `-mno-implicit-float` for clang instead?
