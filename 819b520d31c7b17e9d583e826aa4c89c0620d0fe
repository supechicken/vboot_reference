The only side effect is the warning message\n\n```\nNo valid section \u0027FW_MAIN_A\u0027, missing ecrw version info\n```\n\nwhich will be always printed out whenever futility parses an EC image. The code is refactored to avoid that, because we already know there is no FW_MAIN_A in an EC image. Therefore `load_firmware_image` needs to differentiate between AP and EC images.\n\n\u003e Even if yes, I\u0027d prefer the refactoring should be done separately, not combined in such a large patch.\n\nOkay, fair enough. Regarding that, instead of splitting `load_firmware_image` into 2 functions, how about adding `bool is_ec` to `struct firmware_image`?",
