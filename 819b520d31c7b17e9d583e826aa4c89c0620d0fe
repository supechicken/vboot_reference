We used to trust the image-\u003eprogrammer to decide what to do (although this was later became more complicated due to servo flashing)\n2. EC was never a core target to support in the updater\n\nIs there a reason why the original method won\u0027t work? Even if yes, I\u0027d prefer the refactoring should be done separately, not combined in such a large patch.",
