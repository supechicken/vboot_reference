      "message": "I agree with Ihor here. We need as much diagnostic info as possible. Especially for the FW OTA, where all we have are the `futility` logs. I have many problems with diagnostics the FW OTA issues due to lack of proper logs and this one might be actually very helpful.\n\nI\u0027d also add the `stat()` call for the `current_path` so we know that it\u0027s not present (missing driver) or if some MAC like SELinux blocks the access to it. @ihorlukianov@google.com Please add path checking here. It should be a separate CL below this one. Also adjust the message accordingly.",
