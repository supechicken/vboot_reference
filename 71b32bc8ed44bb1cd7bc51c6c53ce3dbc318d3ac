      "message": "I think it would be good to move this one into a shared file (e.g. lib20/misc.c or packed_key.c) and also use it in vb2_load_fw_keyblock()). I would suggest an API of\n\n // Loads key data onto the provided workbuf state, figuring out the right\n // size and only loading as much as necessary. \n vb2_read_gbb_key(ctx, offset, size, \u0026wb)\n\nThen you don\u0027t really malloc anything anymore, the functions using root and recovery key can just load, use and discard the key directly on the workbuf. All this is probably too much for one CL, but we should try to move in that direction (i.e. don\u0027t persist anything on the workbuf permanently and just always memcpy() to malloc() for now until we can get rid of that too).",

Although I am still thinking that vb2_load_fw_keyblock could call VbGbbReadRootKey directly, since that\u0027s the key it needs?  In that case, not sure if we want to continue passing the vb2_workbuf all the way down, or just pass the VbPublicKey pointer back, and assume the caller knows not to mess with the workbuf while using the VbPublicKey data.",

      "message": "Actually, sorry, after reading this again I think we in fact *have* to pass the workbuf through already in this patch (which will expand its footprint even more, unfortunately). We have to be really careful when using the workbuffer and I think this version may already do something dangerous. vb2_workbuf_from_ctx() is not a function we can just randomly call anywhere without carefully looking at the call stack.\n\nIf you look at VbVerifyMemoryBootImage(), it calls VbGbbReadRecoveryKey() (which will allocate the recovery key on the workbuffer here), and then a couple of lines later it calls vb2_workbuf_from_ctx() to pass a workbuffer into vb2_verify_keyblock() (which uses it for scratch space). We don\u0027t write back the current workbuffer state after reading the recovery key, so that scratch space will in fact use the same bytes and corrupt the key. If you try to boot an image in recovery mode with this patch, I think it should blow up.\n\nBut writing back the workbuffer state wouldn\u0027t help either... it\u0027s just coincidence that VbVerifyMemoryBootImage() calls vb2_workbuf_from_ctx() *after* VbGbbReadRecoveryKey(). It might as well have been written to call that at the top of the function instead. I think we need to institute a policy (in reviews, at least... I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a good way to codify that) that functions may only call vb2_workbuf_from_ctx() if they\u0027re certain that no other function above them in the call stack has been using the work buffer before them. So essentially it should only be called in \"top-level\" API entry points (or things close to that, at least), and never in low-level utility functions that can be called from multiple points (like this one). For those, they need to always take in an explicit work buffer pointer.",
