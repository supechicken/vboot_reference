Who\u0027s to say we wouldn\u0027t need to attempt one-shot booting from a removable disk in the future?\n\nIt would be slightly arduous to move all of the recovery reason-setting code up in the stack to the three TryLoadKernel calls that need it.  Would it be that terrible to add a boolean argument to this function called something like \"recover_on_failure\" or \"ignore_failure\"?\n\nOr we could also wrap the function in another one which deals with setting the recovery request, e.g. TryLoadKernelOrFail().",
