      "message": "This \"works\", but I\u0027m still not convinced it\u0027s a great solution.  This is basically tying the behaviour of the UI into the implementation of TryLoadKernel itself.  Who\u0027s to say we wouldn\u0027t need to attempt one-shot booting from a removable disk in the future?\n\nIt would be slightly arduous to move all of the recovery reason-setting code up in the stack to the three TryLoadKernel calls that need it.  Would it be that terrible to add a boolean argument to this function called something like \"recover_on_failure\" or \"ignore_failure\"?\n\nOr we could also wrap the function in another one which deals with setting the recovery request, e.g. TryLoadKernelOrFail().",

If we ever need to change it, then yeah, adding another parameter or something to control that would be easy. But I don\u0027t see a reason to add more code right now while we don\u0027t yet have any plans of ever needing it?",
