      "message": "Unless there\u0027s a valid reason, I don\u0027t think we should remove existing tests like this. Instead, adding a new test case looks more reasonable to me. However, I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s necessary, because most cases should be covered in vb2_inject_kernel_subkey_tests.c.\n\nJulius, how\u0027s this test different from the ones in vb2_load_kernel_tests.c, except that this loads the key from a file?",

      "message": "Well, it\u0027s not removing the test, it\u0027s just reusing the new API function that now does the same thing which this test previously did manually, right? As such I think this is a good change.\n\nThis is a higher level integration test, while vb2_load_kernel_tests.c is a lower level unit test just for the load_kernel code. This one will actually load and parse a real GPT image, while the other one mocks those parts out. I think they both have their place.",
