Do we have anything better that can explicitly know \"we are running inside VM\"?\n\nAlso, there may be proto devices that have broken devsw_boot (with on HWID provisioned).  You probably want to trust other values, for example mainfw_type \u003d\u003d nonchrome to see if we\u0027re really not on Chromebooks.",
