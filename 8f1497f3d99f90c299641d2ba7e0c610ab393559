      "message": "Yes, refer to mosys the comment shows \"/* Only unibuild has the concept of a signature ID */\". So for non-unibuild projects it seems there is not identifier to match something. I imaging that in the factory finalize, if key word - \"single key\" is appeared in VERSION.signer then this is not a uni-build project. And there would be one rootkey hash (root:) I need to do match directly with current firmware in the flash.\n\nThanks Charles\u0027s suggestion and will change name to \u0027root\u0027.",
