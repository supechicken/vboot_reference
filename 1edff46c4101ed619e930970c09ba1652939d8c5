      "message": "One problem you get here is that you can lock the TPM (by just entering the menu which calls prepare()) and then still back out and chose another boot method. I guess we already had that with legacy payloads that fail previously, but now it\u0027s even easier to do. I think developer mode generally doesn\u0027t write to the kernel TPM space so that\u0027s probably fine, but we should double-check whether the second attempt to lock TPM (if you back out and then try a normal boot instead, or if you just enter and exit the menu multiple times) doesn\u0027t cause it to fail and go into recovery mode or something.",
