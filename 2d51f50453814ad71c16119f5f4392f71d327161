      "message": "By the way it would be good if you could (maybe in a follow-up so we can get this in asap) fix the tests to check for this case. I believe vb2_auxfw_sync_tests.c already tries to do this, but unfortunately it mocks the display switch in vb2ex_auxfw_check() whereas depthcharge does it in vb2ex_auxfw_update(). This seems to have moved during review in CL:2117776 and then I guess we forgot to update the test to test the new behavior. :( (Maybe for future robustness it would be best to check both versions in the test.)",
