The third arg is the number of chars to copy, not sizeof(buf).\n\nNote that Strncat() behaves differently than strncat(); for Strncat (capital), the third param is the size of the destination buffer.\n\nSo what we really need to pass in the third arg is sizeof(buf) - strlen(buf) - 1.\n\nAnd we should think about renaming Strncat() to something else (or perhaps removing it) to avoid this confusion in the future...",
