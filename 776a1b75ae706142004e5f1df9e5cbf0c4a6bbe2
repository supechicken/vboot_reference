      "message": "I don\u0027t understand why this and NO_BOOT_MODE are separate flags. As I understand your doc, \"NO_RECOVERY\" just means \"NO_BOOT + RECOVERY\". So then we should represent that with those two flags rather than having three.",

      "message": "I think you need to separate the UI stuff from the software sync stuff here, and integrate the software sync stuff into the existing software sync code (in ec_sync.c). Note that there\u0027s currently a bunch of work by Tim and Joel going on in that area (e.g. CL:1867314). When they move software sync into romstage, most of this will not run as part of SelectAndLoadKernel() anymore.",

      "message": "Like I mentioned in the design doc, I think it would be advantageous to treat this as a special TPM NVRAM space (or maybe even make it part of the kernel space). In that case, vboot should treat it like the other \"secdata\" -- there should be an array in vb2_context that\u0027s filled out by coreboot before first calling into vboot, and if vboot changes it will eventually be written back.",
