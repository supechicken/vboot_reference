      "message": "In general, I think showing this information is a good idea.  However:\n\n(1) Can we show \" (dev)\" for kernel subkey as well?\n(2) I\u0027m a bit worried that we are introducing multiple ways of doing the same thing.  In 2kernel.c vb2api_is_developer_signed, we\u0027re looking at the starting bytes of the raw key rather than comparing hashes.  Perhaps we could use the same strategy?  And would it make sense to expose this information via an API as well, or perhaps even pre-calculate the dev-ness of the keys and store in vb2_context flags or something like that?  +jwerner to comment as the author of vb2api_is_developer_signed.\n(3) Unless we have a good reason to update legacy UI code, could we keep it frozen?  It\u0027s currently not built on ToT, and we are going to remove it soon.  Could we take that change out?",
