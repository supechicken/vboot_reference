      "message": "I would rather not attach this at such a low level so that `futility update` will return weird errors that don\u0027t immediately explain what\u0027s going on. The whole command is used only for flashing and cannot work without flashrom support. So I think you should just attach this directly in cmd_update.c... something like:\n\n #ifdef USE_FLASHROM\n\n ...rest of the file...\n\n #else /* USE_FLASHROM */\n\n static int do_update(int argc, char *argv[])\n {\n   FATAL(MYNAME \" was built without flashrom support, `update` command unavailable!\\n\");\n }\n\n DECLARE_FUTIL_COMMAND(update, do_update, VBOOT_VERSION_ALL, \"(unavailable in this build)\");\n \n #endif /* !USE_FLASHROM */\n\n(You should be able to drop updater.c, updater_archive.c, updater_quirks.c and updater_utils.c from compilation then.)",
