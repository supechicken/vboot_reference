It\u0027s probably time to give vboot more explicit access to the actual coreboot timestamps (since just writing it in the log like this isn\u0027t very discoverable). I\u0027d suggest adding a new `void vb2ex_timestamp(enum vb2_timestamps)` and then have depthcharge translate those vboot timestamps (counting from 0) into coreboot timestamps by adding a suitable base value (e.g. 1150).",

      "message": "Oh no, please don\u0027t use statics to track stuff here, we have `avb_data-\u003eparams` for that.\n\nIn general, I would really like to avoid the needing to load things out of order in here. It would be cleanest if this was a very simple callback: AVB tells us to load partition X, so we load partition X. The whole \"oh wait maybe we need to load partition Y first so we can place it before that\" is pretty ugly.\n\nIs the order of loaded partitions in `kernel_buffer` actually important? (I know for arm64 it shouldn\u0027t be because we memcpy() the whole thing again right before entering the kernel anyway. Less sure for x86.) If not, I think the best solution here would be to just load the partitions one after the other into the buffer in the order they are requested. All you need for that is a `kernel_buffer_used` value in `vb2_kernel_params`, and offset values for each partition type we expect to load.\n\nYou shouldn\u0027t even need all these separate load_kernel/load_ramdisk functions here then, the loading process should basically be the same for everything, only the partition name, the `vb2_kernel_params` member you store the offset in and the timestamp ID you log would change.",
