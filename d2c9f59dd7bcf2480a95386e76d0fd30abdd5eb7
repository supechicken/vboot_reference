(Also, `vb2_desc_size()` uses the `strlen()` to determine that size, so it is fine to use `strcpy()` on the same string later.)\n\nThe only thing that I think might potentially be missing here is a\n```\nif (!s.c.desc_size)\n  desc \u003d NULL;\n```\nright after desc_size is initialized, to account for the `desc \u003d\u003d \u0027\\0\u0027` case.",
