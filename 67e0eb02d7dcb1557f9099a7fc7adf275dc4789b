We only have one kernel version now (the one from the kernel we pick), and it is only written, so we don\u0027t really need to initialize this variable. (If we want to hedge against the possibility that the OS-specific load_kernel-functions might return success without writing to this, even though that\u0027s not supposed to happen, the best safe value to initialize this to would probably be 0.)",
