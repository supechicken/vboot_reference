      "message": "For completeness, should I also handle this GBB flag in the other places where VbExIsShutdownRequested is called (recovery mode, and confirmation screen)? Our current use case doesn\u0027t require it, and I know that recovery mode transition is security-sensitive. On the other hand, someday it may be useful to someone (like for FAFT testing with lid closed, maybe).",
